         <description>In an interview with France Football, Manchester City&amp;#8217;s Mario Balotelli spoke with the French magazine about his role in the Azurri&amp;#8217;s attack as well as the views others have of him.

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an interview with <em>France Football</em>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forzaitalianfootball.com/tag/manchester-city/" class="st_tag internal_tag" title="Posts tagged with Manchester City">Manchester City</a>&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forzaitalianfootball.com/tag/mario-balotelli/" class="st_tag internal_tag" title="Posts tagged with Mario Balotelli">Mario Balotelli</a> spoke with the French magazine about his role in the Azurri&#8217;s attack as well as the views others have of him.</p>
<p>When asked whether he thinks he is a &#8220;genius or a rebel,&#8221; Balotelli answered, &#8220;Yes, I think I am a genius, but not a rebel. I have my life, my world, I act how I want without stepping on anyone&#8217;s toes.&#8221;</p>
<p><div style="float:right;margin:10px 0 10px 20px;"></div> Upon being asked to clarify his answer, the Italian international responded, &#8220;I think I&#8217;m smarter than the average person, but I swear I&#8217;m not interested in showing it off.&#8221; &#8216;Super Mario&#8217; also expressed gratitude towards having managers like <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forzaitalianfootball.com/tag/roberto-mancini/" class="st_tag internal_tag" title="Posts tagged with Roberto Mancini">Roberto Mancini</a> at City and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forzaitalianfootball.com/tag/cesare-prandelli/" class="st_tag internal_tag" title="Posts tagged with Cesare Prandelli">Cesare Prandelli</a> for the national team.
<p>&#8220;He [Mancini] really knows me, it&#8217;s more than a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forzaitalianfootball.com/tag/coach/" class="st_tag internal_tag" title="Posts tagged with Coach">coach</a>-player rapport, there is a friendship between us. When he played he was a bit like me. I&#8217;m sent off for some fouls, but so have others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Balotelli also considers the upcoming European Championship to be &#8220;the most important moment of my career up to this point.&#8221; He also added that the tournament would not be his last, but &#8220;the first of many.&#8221; On a personal level, he promises to play some &#8220;great matches&#8221; and that if <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forzaitalianfootball.com/tag/italy/" class="st_tag internal_tag" title="Posts tagged with Italy">Italy</a> &#8220;must be eliminated, I will leave with my head held high.&#8221;</p>
<p>The striker lists legendary Brazilian forward Ronaldo to be his reference point. &#8220;For me he is a god, to meet him is a dream that hasn&#8217;t been realized. Absolutely he is my idol. If the day comes that I meet him, I&#8217;ll have goosebumps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking about personal problems, and the inevitable accounts of racism, including an ugly episode in 2009 against <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forzaitalianfootball.com/tag/roma/" class="st_tag internal_tag" title="Posts tagged with Roma">Roma</a> when some individuals threw bananas at him from the stands.</p>
<p>&#8220;These two or three guys were lucky that the police quickly arrived because, I swear I would have beat them up. Really, I would have destroyed them. I hope it never happens again. If someone throws a banana in my direction, I&#8217;ll end up in prison because I&#8217;ll kill them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not making a proposition as seen from the government, but it is a wish that I, as a passionate fan of football for many years, feel if for two or three years would us Italians not benefit from the suspension of the sport,&#8221; the PM stated in a press conference, responding to a question asked to him about his feelings towards the current news.</p>
<p><div style="float:right;margin:10px 0 10px 20px;"></div> &#8220;It&#8217;s so easy for the vast majority of Italians to pinpoint all the ills of Italian politics, but it&#8217;s a mistake: there are grave, grave, defects in politics but in a country there doesn&#8217;t exist this separateness between politics and civil society that some members of society think does exist.
<p>&#8220;I find it unacceptable, and it worried me also when I was the EU Commissioner, that public funds were used to write off football clubs.&#8221;</p>

         <description>Pescara president Daniele Sebastiani has revealed that Zdenek Zeman is eager to make a return to Roma with an appetite for revenge.

<p>Following the departure of Luis Enrique, Zeman is tipped to take over by the end of the week. This marks a return for the 65-year-old to the capital club since leaving 13 years ago. </p>
<p>Facing the loss of the experienced tactician to the Giallorossi, Sebastiani reflected that he saw this coming and despite attempts to convince him to stay, the calling of Rome was too strong a pull for Zeman. </p>
<p><div style="float:right;margin:10px 0 10px 20px;"></div> The President told Sky Sports Italia, “I spoke with him last night, when he informed me that he was continuing with negotiations. He wanted to stay, but I knew six months ago that only a call from Roma would take his attention, I knew everything.
<p>“I understand that there is nothing definitive, but from giving ourselves a week to decide, we will not get caught unprepared. Why can he not turn them down? He has explained it to me as a great sense of revenge. As Roma, I would hardly consider another choice myself either.”</p>
<p>In a last ditch attempt to convince the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forzaitalianfootball.com/tag/coach/" class="st_tag internal_tag" title="Posts tagged with Coach">coach</a> to stay, Sebastiani had this advice for Zeman.</p>
<p>“If I were the Coach, I would not go, even if overpaid.</p>
<p>“Is there a last attempt to convince him to stay? I spoke with him last night, it is not a matter of contract, money or a project, yesterday his wife left in tears because they do not want to leave Pescara.</p>
<p>“Revenge and man are one, I think it is just that.”</p>

<p>Following a number of player arrests yesterday, it has been confirmed that both Italian international Domenico Cristo and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forzaitalianfootball.com/tag/juventus/" class="st_tag internal_tag" title="Posts tagged with Juventus">Juventus</a> boss Antonio Conte are now under investigation.</p>
<p>The police have conducted a search at Italy&#8217;s Coverciano training base in Florance, focussing on Criscito’s room. The search was carried out yesterday morning at 6.30am to ensure that no evidence was removed.</p>
<p><div style="float:right;margin:10px 0 10px 20px;"></div> Following the revelations De Rossi stated, “From my personal point of view, this is worse than 2006. Back then club directors were involved, now I’m seeing friends and teammates. We woke up yesterday to see police there and we instantly understood the seriousness of the situation.&#8221;
<p>“I don’t know what to think. I tried to put myself in the place of those involved and it won’t be easy for them. My biggest fear is that there is something horrible underneath all of this.”</p>
<p>With the seriousness of the situation Criscito was subsequently dropped from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forzaitalianfootball.com/tag/euro-2012/" class="st_tag internal_tag" title="Posts tagged with Euro 2012">Euro 2012</a> squad and is just under investigation. However, Lazio and Italy midfielder Stefano Mauri was arrested.</p>
<p>“Mauri is not a delinquent by any means, he’s an excellent player as well as a good guy. I really hope he comes out of this clean,” De Rossi concluded.</p>

As yet it has not reached the magnitude of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2011/jun/16/italy-match-fixing-giuseppe-signori?INTCMP=SRCH&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;2006 Calciopoli affair&lt;/a&gt;, which left a shadow over Italy's World Cup triumph, but after police raided both the quarters of the national team and the home of Antonio Conte, manager of the Italian champions, Juventus, it's set to make as least as big a splash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The roots of the latest scandal lie in the summer of 2011. After a member of Serie B side Cremonese suffered a serious car crash, tests showed that he and other members of the team had been drugged with sleeping pills. The culprit was one of their own teammates, Marco Paolini, who had been attempting to pay off a mounting series of gambling debts by arranging a series of defeats for his bookies. Cremonese's unexpected winning streak had forced him to take desperate measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It soon became clear that Paoloni was merely the tip of the iceberg. Famous names such as Atalanta's captain Cristiano Doni and the legendary Lazio striker Giuseppe Signori were arrested as evidence emerged of others willing to throw games, or procure others to fix results, for at least two international betting syndicates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phonetap evidence abounded, but not all of it was conclusive: Paolini would often boast of contacts with big-name players that he didn't have in the hope of earning a payout for a result that had actuallyin fact come about naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the southern city of Bari a parallel inquiry investigation was underway that brought some extraordinary admissions. Bari's captain revealed that he had deliberately scored the own goal that saved their neighbours and biggest rivals from relegation. How angry were their fans about this? Not very; Bari's goalkeeper alleged that leaders of the club's own supporters were among those in on the fixes, on one occasion even visiting his house to urge him to lose, so they could make money on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reactions in Italy to all this has have been mixed. While Atalanta's fans responded with fury to the news of Doni's involvement, for many other fansmany others just felt a sense of weary resignation. This is after all a nation still dealing with the fallout of the Calciopoli scandal, which saw Italy's biggest club, Juventus, stripped of two titles and relegated to Serie B. The idea that not everything in the game is strictly above board is hardly a revelation. Fans' expectations are at have been lowered to rock bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And few expect much to change; when Juve were recently crowned champions for the first time since the 2006 scandal, they arbitrarily decided to reclaim the two lost titles. The Italian FA did nothing to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a sense that this has so far been merely the foothills of the real scandal, with the big names yet to emerge. Monday morning's police actions have certainly obliged on that front. In the headline-grabbing early morning raid on the base of the Italian national side, police searched the room of defender Domenico Criscito and served him with an official notice of investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in Rome, Lazio's captain, Stefano Mauri, was led away in handcuffs, one of 19 people arrested. The tactics are deliberately high profile and carry echoes of the Totonero scandal of 1980, which saw carabinieri waiting pitchside to arrest players as they came off at the final whistle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police case may take years to complete, but sporting sanctions will be immediate, for just as in 2006 the Italian FA is fast-tracking its own trials to have penalties in place for the start of the new season, with the first of the hearings beginning this Thursday in Rome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More arrests will almost certainly follow in the next few weeks, and at least three Serie A clubs – Lazio, Genoa and Siena – may begin next season with significant points deductions. Beyond that though, the broader question is whether the Italian game will ever be truly free of match-fixing. &quot;This investigation could go on eternally, if only we had the manpower,&quot; as one investigator put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just six years on from the last major match-fixing scandal, and with a succession of smaller tremors peppering the years before and since, that Italy should found itself again mired in scandal truly suggests that football here is not simply a sport, but rather a vehicle where – regardless of what happens on the field – everyone can win, if they have the right connections. In which case, the loser will always be football.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;related&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/serieafootball&quot;&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/italy&quot;&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news&quot;&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/europeanfootball&quot;&gt;European football&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/sport-betting&quot;&gt;Sport betting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/juventus&quot;&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/siena&quot;&gt;Siena&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/atalanta&quot;&gt;Atalanta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/bari&quot;&gt;Bari&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/lazio&quot;&gt;Lazio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/italy&quot;&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesrichardson&quot;&gt;James Richardson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;terms&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scudetto 2011/2012<br />
A triumphant march to the title, consisting of 38 games without defeat. An unforgettable Scudetto victory that nobody would have imagined at the dawn of a new era.<br />
Antonio Conte, already a fans’ favourite after captaining a highly successful Bianconeri side in the ‘90s, returned in May 2011 to oversee a revolution at his beloved Juventus. Big name additions to the playing staff subsequently followed, such as Lichtsteiner, Vucinic, Vidal and, above all, Andrea Pirlo. Yet the promising acquisitions failed to place Juventus among the pre-season title contenders. The general consensus was that the club was in a phase of reconstruction following two consecutive seventh-place finishes, and that defending champions Milan were the ones to beat.<br />
But the winds of change appeared to sweep across Turin quicker than expected. First of all, the Bianconeri had their brand new home, Juventus Stadium, in which the fans’ proximity to the pitch saw them become the twelfth man to spur Conte’s men onto victory.<br />
And then there was the style of play itself. The new management succeeded in instilling added aggression and quality, initially arranged in a 4-2-4 formation, which soon became a 4-3-3, before eventually evolving into a 3-5-2. Regardless of the personnel deployed, Juve shot out of the traps at an electrifying pace, immediately establishing themselves as Milan’s most plausible rivals after a commanding 2-0 win over the Rossoneri at Juventus Stadium. Further impressive results soon followed, such as the away wins over Inter and Lazio and memorable comebacks against Napoli and Roma. The Bianconeri ended the first half of the campaign as Winter Champions. They had the opportunity to extend their lead even further, but several postponed fixtures and a series of draws allowed Milan to move back into top spot.<br />
Juve’s title aspirations appeared to have faded when they lined up against Fiorentina at the Artemio Franchi, seven points adrift of the Rossoneri. Yet Conte’s men possessed a fighting spirit that mirrored the determination of their inspirational leader, stringing together eight consecutive victories and reclaiming pole position after Milan’s slip ups against Catania and Fiorentina. A home draw against Lecce set nerves jangling, but any fears were soon allayed by a solid 2-0 away win over Cagliari. Milan’s defeat to rivals Inter gave Juventus an unassailable four-point lead at the top, leaving Alessandro Del Piero with the honour of signing off in front of his own public by lifting Scudetto number 30 the following week at Juventus Stadium.</p>

It is a fresh scandal that has evoked memories of a terrible episode in 2006 that shook the Italian game to its core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Conte's reaction is that of someone who's completely innocent and strongly determined to prove his total innocence,&quot; Conte's lawyer, Antonio De Rencis, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation of Conte concerns his time with Siena, when the 42-year-old led the Bianconeri to promotion from the second tier last season. A year on he stood on the sidelines and watched a team in the same colours march undefeated to the title, but with 2006's scandal still raw, the latest investigation will damage the rebuilding process that has been taking place in Turin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juventus were not directly involved in the arrests on Monday, with the Italian media reporting that the games under suspicion involve Napoli, Sampdoria, Brescia, Bari, Lecce, Palermo, Genoa and Lazio. However, with the champions' reputation having taken a severe hit during recent years, this fresh investigation has brought the previous trauma back to the fore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Republic of Ireland manager, Giovanni Trapattoni, has voiced his astonishment at the latest probe. Trapattoni, who has twice managed Juve, told Gazzetta dello Sport: &quot;It is a devastating story. If the magistrates are doing something, it is because there is some truth in this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I, who have travelled abroad for some time, must say that we give an ugly image of our football. As an Italian, the first feeling is that we are mocked abroad, we are always linked to illicit dealings and are considered mafia members. This only damages us because I can claim to have paid the price for an attitude that affects everyone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La Repubblica have reported that investigators into the current outbreak are probing a meeting on 11 May between two Genoa players, two members of Genoa's Ultra fan group and a known Bosnian criminal, with suggestions that much of the match rigging was organised by an Eastern European gang that paid out significant sums to players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, however, the scandal centred around the bribing of match officials, with the Juventus general managers Luciano Moggi and Antonio Giraudo influencing the appointment of referees – selecting officials who would favour their side. Bans, heavy fines and jail sentences were the punishments handed out by the authorities, after telephone interceptions revealed the extent of the network of relations between managers, players and officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former left-back Gianluca Pessotto's apparent attempt to take his own life on the eve of the corruption hearings in 2006, having been appointed by the club to try and restore some order amid the chaos, was no doubt the nadir for the Old Lady. But Juve have since ascended back to the summit and returned to their domineering force of old, securing another Scudetto in spectacular fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of Juve players went on to lift the World Cup in Germany, viewed by many as a glorious redemption amid a whirlwind of turmoil. The following season Juventus returned to Serie A at the first time of asking, players such as Alessandro Del Piero and Gianluigi Buffon remaining loyal as Didier Deschamps led them to promotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outpouring of emotion at Trieste's Stadio Nereo Rocco, when Juve clinched the title against Cagliari earlier this month, was therefore all the more significant given the travails of the last six years, but Conte's reputation and role throughout the campaign may now come into question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;related&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/juventus&quot;&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/serieafootball&quot;&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/europeanfootball&quot;&gt;European football&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/james-riach&quot;&gt;James Riach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;terms&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

When the fourth official's board went up at 10.33pm on Sunday evenimg, calling time on&lt;em&gt; Il Pinturicchio&lt;/em&gt;'s Juventus career, he simply ran to the sideline and was replaced. Unlike a week earlier, when supporters at his final home appearance had &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/may/14/juventus-alessandro-del-piero-farewell&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;demanded a mid-game lap of honour&lt;/a&gt;, there was no time for sentimentality here. The &lt;em&gt;Bianconeri&lt;/em&gt; had less than 30 minutes to rescue their unbeaten season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also the small matter of a trophy being at stake. Twelve months and five days removed from their last defeat, at Parma in their penultimate game of 2010‑11, Juventus found themselves a goal down to Napoli in the Coppa Italia final. By claiming the Scudetto, Antonio Conte's side had already exceeded all expectations for this campaign but after 42 games the thought of missing this chance to become the first Italian side ever to complete an undefeated double was galling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juventus, though, were not the only ones with an eye on the history books. Not since 1990, when Diego Maradona led them to the Scudetto then victory in the pre-season SuperCoppa – against Juventus, no less – had Napoli got their hands on any meaningful silverware. In the interim they had gone bust, having to be relaunched in the third tier in 2004 under a new owner, Aurelio De Laurentiis, and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2011/nov/19/napoli-manchester-city-champions-league&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;initially under a different name&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Napoli's resurrection had been confirmed by this year's run to the last 16 of the Champions League, then the desire to crown it with a trophy was palpable. The captain, Paolo Cannavaro, was only eight when the club claimed that last Scudetto – still a boy and yet old enough to remember celebrations which got so out of hand that fans tagged gravestones with graffiti reading &quot;You don't know what you're missing&quot;. He told reporters last week that &quot;winning here would be better than winning a World Cup and a Ballon d'Or&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such words were, of course, aimed at his brother Fabio, who claimed both in 2006, but there was no questioning how much this trophy would mean to the younger sibling. Having supported the &lt;em&gt;Partenopei&lt;/em&gt; since he was a child, Paolo now had the chance to become the first Neapolitan to lift the Coppa Italia as captain since Antonio Juliano in 1976.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor was this just about the locals. The fear that this team could be broken up this summer has been palpable for some time – Napoli's remarkable European run bringing players such as Edinson Cavani and Ezequiel Lavezzi to the attention of the continent's richest clubs. With the latter, in particular, being linked strongly to both Paris St-Germain and Internazionale, the whole squad approached this game knowing their window to claim a trophy together was closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lavezzi had been jeered and whistled by Napoli's supporters over his supposed disloyalty at the end of their final league game, a 2-1 home win over Siena, yet it was he who effectively broke the deadlock on Sunday, winning a penalty when he raced through to be brought down by the Juventus goalkeeper Marco Storari early in the second half. De Laurentiis was too nervous to watch as Cavani, who had twice failed to convert from the spot this season, slotted the ball calmly into the bottom right corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal was just reward for Napoli, who had been the more enterprising team throughout, even if they were fortunate not to have given away a penalty at the end of the first half, when Salvatore Aronica arrived late into a challenge on Claudio Marchisio inside the area. Conte responded to their goal by replacing Del Piero and Stephan Lichtsteiner with Mirko Vucinic and Simone Pepe. He would soon withdraw Marco Borriello, too, in favour of Fabio Quagliarella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At last Juventus began to show some threat, Leonardo Bonucci drawing a fine save from Morgan De Sanctis with a volley from the edge of the box. The keeper could claim less credit after his feet got in the way of a Pepe drive across goal which had been redirected back towards the near post by Quagliarella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is no secret that Napoli do their best work on the counterattack. With seven minutes to play Marek Hamsik completed a lightning break by clipping the ball across Storari to extend his team's lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juventus had recovered from two goals down against Napoli already once this season – having trailed 2-0 and then 3-1 before eventually drawing 3-3 in the league meeting at San Paolo – but with so little time remaining there was never a sense that the feat could be repeated. Unable to pull even one back, they were instead reduced to 10 men when Quagliarella swung an elbow at Aronica after the latter had been manhandling him at a set-piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At full-time Del Piero trudged out from the dugout to thank Juventus's fans with glossy eyes. &quot;We close an extraordinary season with a bitter taste in our mouths,&quot; he said. &quot;But even if we didn't put the cherry on top, we did still take home the cake.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tears were shed by the victors too, Lavezzi in particular getting choked up at the final whistle. This was the Argentinian's fifth season with Napoli – having joined the club just as they returned to the top-flight. He has spoken many times of his affection for the city, but more recently also of the difficulties of day-to-day life in such an environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a furious reaction – including from De Laurentiis – when Lavezzi's girlfriend, Yanina Screpante, defined Naples as a &quot;shit city&quot; on Twitter after being robbed of her watch at gunpoint, but the player's own words in an interview given to Sportweek magazine not long afterwards were more revealing. He spoke of how it was impossible for him to even go to the park when his son, who lives in Argentina, comes to visit, due to the inevitability of getting mobbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a show of emotion on Sunday would appear to suggest that this was indeed his final appearance for the club, but there will be time enough to worry about transfers in the weeks ahead. This was a moment to celebrate, the players tossing their manager, Walter Mazzarri, up into the air in the customary fashion. Hamsik, as he had promised to do, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.julienews.it/pensieroazzurro/notizia/notizie/hamsik-rasa-la-cresta-ho-mantenuto-la-promessa/28177_notizie_0.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;allowed team-mates to shave off his Mohawk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team did not get back to Naples from Rome until roughly 4am, yet still found the streets lined with tens of thousands of supporters as they &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ilmessaggero.it/sport/calcio/napoli_festa_sul_pullman_scoperto_delirio_in_strada_sino_allalba/notizie/197536.shtml&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;launched into an immediate open-top bus parade&lt;/a&gt;. They might not yet have reached the heights achieved with Diego Maradona but 25 years on from their first Scudetto, this felt like a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;related&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/napoli&quot;&gt;Napoli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/serieafootball&quot;&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/europeanfootball&quot;&gt;European football&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/juventus&quot;&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paolobandini&quot;&gt;Paolo Bandini&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;terms&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The 37-year-old tried his luck again five minutes into the second half but was well wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Napoli broke the deadlock just after the hour when Storari brought down Lavezzi in the penalty area and Cavani converted from the spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juve's best chance of an equaliser fell to Simone Pepe but once again De Sanctis was up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamsik put the result beyond doubt in the 83rd minute, Goran Pandev providing the assist following a brisk counter-attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that was left was for Quagliarella to see red for an elbow on Salvatore Aronica, leaving Napoli celebrating and Del Piero bowing out on a low note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;related&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/napoli&quot;&gt;Napoli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/juventus&quot;&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/europeanfootball&quot;&gt;European football&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/serieafootball&quot;&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;terms&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

         <description>&lt;div class=&quot;track&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.24.1.1/5106?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Champions+League+final+2013%3A+new+pretenders+set+sights+on+Wembley%3AArticle%3A1747823&amp;ch=Football&amp;c3=Obs&amp;c4=Champions+League%2CJuventus+%28Football+club%29%2CBorussia+Dortmund+%28Football+club%29%2CParis+St-Germain+%28Football+club%29%2CFootball%2CSport&amp;c5=Europa+League%2CChampions+League&amp;c6=Amy+Lawrence&amp;c7=12-May-19&amp;c8=1747823&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Feature&amp;c11=Football&amp;c13=&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;c42=Sport&amp;h2=GU%2FSport%2FFootball%2FChampions+League&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;standfirst&quot;&gt;The party is still going strong in Munich but football's glamour game is heading back to London in a year's time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Football's A-listers are in Munich this weekend. Quite apart from the two clubs involved, the Champions League final is a magnet for every club, every coach, every fixer who likes to consider himself a part of the elite. The mingling, preening and backslapping in Uefa's official hotel needs to be seen to be believed. It is as close as football comes to putting on an equivalent of an Oscars afterparty, albeit without the dresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will, though, be a handful of clubs not preoccupied by making an appearance in Germany over the weekend as they are otherwise engaged. Juventus are playing Napoli in the Italian Cup final on Sunday, with a chance to embellish the Alessandro Del Piero farewell tour with another trophy. In France Montpellier visit relegated Auxerre intent on securing the point they need to claim the title for the first time in their history. Paris St-Germain, who need Montpellier to lose, are at Lorient on the final weekend of Ligue 1 fixtures, hungry to pounce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is only when their seasons are finally over that teams such as Juventus, Napoli, Montpellier and PSG can reflect on the significant campaigns they have all had. Napoli, in particular, will not easily forget the leaps and bounds they made in the Champions League this season. The Coppa Italia final gives them a chance to celebrate a campaign that has at times been wonderfully uplifting as they won new friends with their boldness against Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Manchester City. In Serie A they were too inconsistent to finish high enough to qualify for Europe's top table again but this team wants honours before a summer that is likely to see some of its crucial components broken off. Ezequiel Lavezzi is already halfway out of the door of the San Paolo, with his agent flirting openly with PSG and rumours heating up regarding Internazionale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coppa Italia may not be the most adored of competitions but it would mean a great deal to the &lt;em&gt;Partenopei&lt;/em&gt;, who last won it at the height of the Maradona era. &quot;We haven't won a trophy for 25 years and we have all of the ingredients at our disposal to play a great game,&quot; says the Napoli captain, Paolo Cannavaro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juventus go into the final on the back of their invincible &lt;em&gt;scudetto&lt;/em&gt;. They have had a few days to attempt to come down to earth after the volcanic emotions of last weekend, when Del Piero's parting gift of a goal on his last home appearance for the Turin club coincided with the conclusion of an undefeated league campaign, and an open-top bus parade that was defiant and cathartic. Taking their place back at the Italian summit after the &lt;em&gt;calciopoli&lt;/em&gt; scandal was never going to be something to underplay. &quot;It's fun walking down the street in Turin and seeing people hit the brakes in the middle of the road so they can get out of their cars, hug you, cry and thank you for everything,&quot; reflected the coach, Antonio Conte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juventus are eager to return to the Champions League next season after four years in the wilderness and it will be fascinating to see how they fare. They can bring more strength, more savvy, more consistency and a sharper winning mentality to the party than Napoli did. The great unknown issue for next season is that their players do not have much experience at the top level of European competition. Next season there will be only three survivors from the lineup the last time Juventus played a Champions League game – Gianluigi Buffon, Georgio Chiellini and Claudio Marchisio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juve are expected to bolster their squad over the summer. While they must somehow address the departure of Del Piero and are openly in the market for a high-calibre centre-forward, they could do with strengthening in midfield and defence, too. With the added pressures of Champions League football next term, they want more depth in the squad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milan, too, have a recruitment drive on their hands after the retirements of a cluster of old favourites. They have already started, having brought in a couple of free agents, Riccardo Montolivio from Fiorentina and Bakaye Traoré from Nancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Montpellier are favourites to win the league at the expense of PSG, it is not hard to predict which of the French clubs will be aiming to make an impact on next season's Champions League. Montpellier face the same problem Lille experienced a year ago, when they lost three of their most valuable players in one fell swoop as soon as they had won the title. Montpellier are braced for bids to come in for their target man Olivier Giroud, playmaker Younes Belhanda and defensive linchpin Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa. Meanwhile PSG have chequebook and pen at the ready.&amp;nbsp;They have a reported €100m to spend and will hoover up as much talent as they can. They are quite a few players short of the standards they want to reach but the club's Qatari owners will have noticed the strides made by Manchester City this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberto Mancini's team, now that they have proved they have sufficient power and technique to topple Manchester United on the domestic front, are under pressure to make more of an impression in the Champions League. Another early exit will not easily be tolerated now that the club have stepped on to a level where they have to be judged as contenders – as all Premier League winners should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borussia Dortmund have to show they belong with the best in Europe after an inhibited showing last term. Although Shinji Kagawa is on his way out, Jürgen Klopp's team will be boosted by the return of Marco Reus. It was an important signing by Dortmund in that it made the point that the best young Germans do not automatically move to&amp;nbsp;Bayern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no matter how much money is spent elsewhere, as usual, it is hard to escape the feeling that any team that wants to go far in the Champions League will have to ride its luck and get past Spain's heavyweights. Barcelona and Real Madrid are both on the hunt for improvements. Defeat by Chelsea in the semi-finals has made Barça talk again about the merits of having a taller centre- forward, and they also need a left-back. Real are well equipped as a squad but one marquee signing is on the agenda. A goalscorer, with Sergio Agüero, Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie on the radar, is in their sights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after the parties in Munich come to an end planning cranks up for the road to Wembley 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;related&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague&quot;&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/juventus&quot;&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/borussiadortmund&quot;&gt;Borussia Dortmund&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/parisstgermain&quot;&gt;Paris St-Germain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/amylawrence&quot;&gt;Amy Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;terms&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

         <title>Andrea Pirlo's peerless pass-mastery could lift even Trentside fog | Richard Williams</title>

         <description>&lt;div class=&quot;track&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.24.1.1/3427?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Andrea+Pirlo%27s+peerless+pass-mastery+could+lift+even+Trentside+fog+%7C+Ric%3AArticle%3A1745231&amp;ch=Football&amp;c3=Guardian&amp;c4=Serie+A+%28Football%29%2CJuventus+%28Football+club%29%2CAC+Milan+%28Football+club%29%2CNotts+County+%28Football+club%29%2CEuropean+football%2CFootball%2CSport&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CEuropa+League%2CChampions+League&amp;c6=Richard+Williams&amp;c7=12-May-14&amp;c8=1745231&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Comment&amp;c11=Football&amp;c13=&amp;c25=Sport+blog&amp;c30=content&amp;c42=Sport&amp;h2=GU%2FSport%2FFootball%2FSerie+A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;standfirst&quot;&gt;Juventus's pageant with Notts County and the title–winning form of their &lt;em&gt;regista &lt;/em&gt;epitomise a fine moment for the Old Lady&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time I saw Andrea Pirlo was on a cold and fog-shrouded November evening in Monza in 2000, when he was a member of the Italy Under-21 team sent out to confront Howard Wilkinson's England selection. Only 11 minutes had been played when the referee abandoned the match but since&amp;nbsp;that night Pirlo's quality has illuminated every ground on which he has played, and none more so than Juventus's new stadium, where he and his team-mates celebrated the Serie&amp;nbsp;A championship on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A byword for graceful creativity, Pirlo has been the most influential midfield player in Europe this season, bar none. Last summer he left Milan, his home for 10 glittering years in which, mostly under Carlo&amp;nbsp;Ancelotti, he won two European Cups, two Uefa Super Cups, one Fifa Club World Cup and two Italian league titles, and where he had intended to finish his career. But Massimiliano Allegri, Ancelotti's latest successor, wanted to install a different sort of influence in the position Pirlo had made his own, at the base of midfield: someone more physical, more aggressive, such as Mark van&amp;nbsp;Bommel or Massimo Ambrosini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A one-year extension was the best Milan could offer when Pirlo's contract expired. The player reckoned that, at 32, three more years would be about right. Milan declined his suggestion and probably no greater misjudgment has been made since Real Madrid sold Claude Makélélé to make room for David Beckham. Once it became known that Pirlo was on the market, Juventus snapped him up. Their new coach, Antonio Conte, himself a former international midfield player of great distinction, saw Pirlo as the foundation of the side he was building to go with the club's new home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last September the stadium was inaugurated with a stylish gala. Following the speeches and the presentation of great figures associated with the club's history, from Giampiero Boniperti to Edgar Davids, a game took place between Conte's new team and Notts County, the current representatives of the club who, back in 1903, sent Juventus a set of the black and white striped shirts in which they have played ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you think of all the famous clubs who would have happily accepted such an invitation, the Barcelonas and Manchester Uniteds and Bayern Munichs, this was a gesture of great historical sensitivity on the part of Andrea Agnelli, Juve's 36-year-old president, the fourth member of his family to hold the post. It came in response to a tentative call from Jim Rodwell, Notts's chief executive, wanting to ask Juventus to help mark this year's 150th anniversary of the world's oldest professional football club. Certainly, Agnelli responded, but why don't you join our celebrations first?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so it came to pass that the players and officials of a club in the third tier of the English game found themselves on a private jet and in a five-star hotel, all at the expense of hosts for whom their ancestors had done a small favour more than a century earlier. For that, as much as for anything else, I reckon Juventus fully deserve their success in recapturing the Serie&amp;nbsp;A title, the reward for a deed of outstanding dignity and generosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others will conclude that Juve's success in remaining unbeaten throughout the entire league season was more to do with the quality of Pirlo's passing. As he did for year after year in Milan's colours, the newcomer made himself constantly available to his team-mates, always there to receive the ball and move it on in the most relevant direction. He was compass and metronome rolled into one, and he did not get injured or suspended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the very promising Conte showed the extent of his tactical imagination by shuffling his team's formation from an initial 4-2-4 to 4-1-4-1, then to 4-2-3-1, and finally to an alternation between 4-3-3 and 3-5-2, Pirlo remained the keystone, utterly reliable and seemingly ageless. Only the colour of the stripes had changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pirlo began his career as a classic No10, an attacking midfielder in the mould of Gianni Rivera or the young Roberto Baggio. The role did not quite suit him and it was while he was on loan from Internazionale, his first big club, back to Brescia, where he had started out, that the veteran coach Carlo Mazzone identified a new, deeper position from which he could direct the play. He became what Italians call a &lt;em&gt;regista&lt;/em&gt;. Not having a word for it, we borrow a term from American football: the quarterback. Xabi Alonso and Paul Scholes are pretty good exponents but no one in recent times has come close to Pirlo's calm mastery and next month he will be a key figure in Cesare Prandelli's Italy at the Euro 2012 finals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so on Wednesday, four days before their team conclude a highly successful season with an appearance in the Coppa Italia final against Napoli, Agnelli and his fellow directors will open their new club museum, located in the Juventus Stadium (which really deserves a more resonant name). Among their guests will be Ray Trew, Notts County's owner, who rescued the club from their latest flirtation with oblivion two years ago, and Jim Rodwell. With their own anniversary functions already under way, the pair will be hoping to bring back news of a return fixture with the new champions of Italy before the start of next season. Imagine it: Andrea Pirlo at Meadow Lane. Just as long as the Trentside fog holds off&amp;nbsp;… &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;related&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/serieafootball&quot;&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/juventus&quot;&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/acmilan&quot;&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/nottscounty&quot;&gt;Notts County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/europeanfootball&quot;&gt;European football&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/richardwilliams&quot;&gt;Richard Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;terms&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

As things stand it is more likely that he goes away from Manchester. I'm still in Brazil and back on Friday. We will deal with it then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can only say that from my point of view that Ferguson is top of the world. If he [Pogba] leaves Manchester, it is not because of Ferguson. If Ferguson had not been there, he [Pogba] would have left already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Even in our discussions, hearing from him has been amazing and fascinating. He captures like no other manager the essence of football. My opinion is not far away from how Paul thinks of him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;related&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united&quot;&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/juventus&quot;&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamiejackson&quot;&gt;Jamie Jackson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;terms&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

         <title>Juventus say emotional farewell to their beloved Alessandro Del Piero | Paolo Bandini</title>

         <description>&lt;div class=&quot;track&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.24.1.1/58643?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Juventus+say+emotional+farewell+to+their+beloved+Alessandro+Del+Piero+%7C+%3AArticle%3A1744883&amp;ch=Football&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Juventus+%28Football+club%29%2CSerie+A+%28Football%29%2CEuropean+football%2CFootball%2CSport&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CEuropa+League&amp;c6=Paolo+Bandini&amp;c7=12-May-14&amp;c8=1744883&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Blogpost&amp;c11=Football&amp;c13=&amp;c25=Sport+blog&amp;c30=content&amp;c42=Sport&amp;h2=GU%2FSport%2FFootball%2FJuventus&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;standfirst&quot;&gt;Juventus fans wave tearful goodbye to the forward who has given 19 years of service to the new – and unbeaten – Serie A champions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might just have been the longest substitution of all-time. There were 57 minutes on the clock when the board went up showing No10 at Juventus Stadium, calling time on Alessandro Del Piero's last home appearance for the Bianconeri. Approximately 60 seconds later, after turning to bow to the supporters in each stand, Del Piero reached the sideline, to be replaced by Simone Pepe. But it would be at least a quarter of an hour before anyone remembered there was a match in progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Del Piero had been congratulated individually by every one of his team-mates on his way off the field, but now Juventus's fans wanted the same opportunity. At first he walked over to take his place on the bench, stopping to sign one young fan's autograph as he went, but no sooner had he sat down than the 40,000 in attendance were calling him back to his feet, demanding an encore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twice he stood to wave, but quickly it became clear that even this would not be sufficient. And so he descended from the bench and set off on a lap of honour, walking around the edge of the pitch and collecting the scarves which fell at his feet like flowers on the stage of a virtuoso musician. Supporters openly wept as Del Piero fought back his own tears. He would later admit he pretended to tie his shoelace at one point, so we wouldn't see him cry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many supporters continued their futile protest against the decision to let their captain leave, begging for one more year, but while this season has shown Del Piero still has the qualities to contribute it is also hard to imagine a more perfect parting. After 19 years which have included lows – not least the 2006-07 season spent in Serie B – as well as highs the man whom Gianni Agnelli once nicknamed &lt;em&gt;Il Pinturicchio&lt;/em&gt; was bowing out at the very top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had given those supporters one last goal to remember him by, fooling everybody as he shaped to fire one way from the edge of the D &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/a-goal-in-his-final-game-alessandro-del-piero-v-atalanta/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;before crashing the ball into the opposite corner&lt;/a&gt;. That strike, in the 28th minute, had helped his team to complete their unbeaten league season – becoming the first-ever Serie A side to do so in a 38-game campaign. Previously Milan had gone unbeaten over 34 games in 1991-92, and Perugia over 30 games (though they failed to win the league) in 1978-79.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday's newspapers carried all the statistics you could ever wish to know about a remarkable career. In 19 years, Del Piero has played 704 games for Juventus, enjoying a total of 48,785 minutes on the pitch. He has scored 289 goals, hit the woodwork 68 times and missed 12 penalties. He has won 387 games, drawn 197 and lost 120. He has been shown 50 yellow cards, and just two red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To an extent all those figures are premature, with the player still set to play a role in the Coppa Italia final against Napoli on Sunday – as long as he can shake off a knock picked up during a challenge with Riccardo Cazzola in the first minute of the game against Atalanta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in any case those numbers feel meaningless. Del Piero's career is not to be expressed in statistics as much as memories – of the shy but talented teenager who announced his arrival from Padova &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6XxlKJR-BU&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;with a goal against Reggiana back in 1993&lt;/a&gt;, of the young man who &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://ghostgoal.co.uk/2011/01/27/del-piero-bari-vs-juventus-2001/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;marked his father's passing by scoring a beautiful goal against Bari in 2001&lt;/a&gt;, of the 30-something who finally put all those international disappointments behind him by scoring &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la4xKzK_ISA&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;the second goal in Italy's 2006 World Cup semi-final win over Germany&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so many tears were shed for Del Piero on Sunday, it is not for the goals that Juventus will now miss – though make no mistake, he has been crucial on occasion this season, not least in providing a late winner against Lazio – but because his departure marks the end of an era, both in the team's history but also fans' lives. &quot;He will always be our captain,&quot; said the club's president, Andrea Agnelli, at full-time, but what really hurts is the realisation that cannot be the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar emotions were being played out on Sunday at San Siro, where fans displayed huge shirt-shaped &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://twitpic.com/9kx67u&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;banners bearing the names and numbers of Alessandro Nesta, Pippo Inzaghi and Gennaro Gattuso&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom have almost certainly played their last game for the club. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/ATempoDiSport/status/201710062048256001/photo/1&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;The image of Inzaghi's face, contorted with joy&lt;/a&gt; as he celebrated his 126th goal for Milan (at a rate of one every 144 minutes) in the second-half of that game said more than words could about what it has meant to him to play, and score for this club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inzaghi has been frustrated with how he has been used by Massimiliano Allegri this season, and he – like Del Piero – feels he still has something to give. &quot;It's tough to stop with 316 career goals, I have Baggio ahead of me on 318,&quot; he said at full-time. &quot;Used in the right way, I can still give a lot in the last half hour of a game … Maybe I'll copy [Thierry] Henry: I'll go to America and come back for a few months to Milan. I'll speak to Galliani and then we'll see.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milan would beat Novara 2-1, while Juventus overcame Atalanta 3-1, but in both cases the matches had become almost side-shows to the farewell parties – with the Rossoneri also saying goodbye to Clarence Seedorf and Mark van Bommel. Juventus's match was technically still ongoing during Del Piero's lap of honour, but nobody was watching. In those minutes it felt as though even the players on the field were aware – nudging the ball about without any great purpose in a match that had otherwise been perfectly competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were matches of significance this week – Lecce's relegation confirmed as they lost at Chievo, while Udinese completed the quite unthinkable achievement of claiming third place. Despite having the sixth-smallest first-team wage bill in Serie A – roughly one-eighth the size of Milan's, despite selling Alexis Sánchez, Gokhan Inler and Cristian Zápata in the summer and despite losing key players such as Mauricio Isla to lengthy injuries, they had somehow outstripped Lazio, Internazionale, Napoli, Roma and the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet where last season's fourth-place finish was met with unreserved celebrations, here too was a hint of melancholy. Antonio Di Natale is yet to decide whether he will return for another season or retire, as he first threatened to do following last week's win over Genoa, and the manager Francesco Guidolin sparked concern over his future too at full-time. &quot;I need a rest, I am very tired,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't know if my health will allow me another season like this one, if I'll even be ready by July.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so the supporters are left with uncertainty, just as they are over Del Piero's next step. The forward has confirmed his intention to keep playing, noting that &quot;I have my whole life to be a director&quot; and hinting at an interest in English football but adding that he has nothing lined up as yet. &quot;It has been 19 years since I had to worry about transfers,&quot; he said. &quot;The only thing I want to underline right now is the relationship that has developed between me and the people here at Juventus over the last 20 years.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two decades which are now coming to an end. But not before the mother of all celebrations in Turin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Talking points&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The festivities went on long into the night in Turin, with the team moving on from their Scudetto presentation on the pitch to an open-top bus parade through the city. La Stampa's best guess was that there had been &quot;Maybe 300,000, maybe 400,000&quot; fans in attendance for the latter, the newspaper noting that the authorities had struggled to come up with any sort of estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is clear, though, that a fight is brewing between the club and the Italian Football Federation, after the parade bus too turned out to have been branded with all the titles Juventus has won, including those which were stripped as a result of the Calciopoli scandal. &quot;The important things today are the celebrations and the emotions,&quot; said the federation's president Giancarlo Abete. &quot;But it is clear that the number of Scudetti won by Juventus is 28 … The third star? If it is the classic one, linked to the number of Scudetti won, then it cannot be added to the shirt.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• One further concern the federation may have after Sunday is over the fitness of Giorgio Chiellini, the Juventus centre-back hobbling off with a thigh injury which will certainly rule him out of the Coppa Italia final but possibly also Italy's Euro 2012 campaign. The defender was included in Cesare Prandelli's provisional 32-man squad for the tournament, but a final 23-man list must be submitted by 29 May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• It was certainly an interesting squad submitted by Prandelli (you can see the full list here: http://football-italia.net/18774/italy-name-32-players-euro-2012) – including as it did the Siena forward Mattia Destro, Bologna's Alessandro Diamanti and most notably the Pescara midfielder Marco Verratti, whom many are already hailing as Andrea Pirlo's heir. The one question is whether he has left himself without a natural prima punta to lead the line up front, having overlooked the likes of Alessandro Matri, Daniel Pablo Osvaldo and Giampaolo Pazzini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Returning to Serie A, Lazio recovered from a goal down to beat Inter 3-1 and take fourth – a spot which will secure them automatic qualification to the Europa League group stage unless Napoli defeat Juventus in the Coppa Italia final. In that case they, like Inter, will go into that tournament's preliminary rounds. Either way the Nerazzurri, having finished sixth, will have the earliest start next season, with a third-round qualifier as soon as 2 August. It is expected their team by then could include Ezequiel Lavezzi, the Napoli forward having been whistled and jeered by his own club's fans after their 2-1 win over Siena on account of his reported interest in a move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Despite winning, the Lazio manager Edy Reja is not guaranteed to remain with the club next year. The club's director of sport Igli Tare would say only that his future would be decided &quot;in the next few days&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• At the other end, Genoa had Alberto Gilardino and Giuseppe Sculli to thank for the goals which meant they would have stayed up even if Lecce had won. The team's owner, Enrico Preziosi, promptly promised a complete overhaul, saying: &quot;I don't intend to abandon ship, but there is probably a need to change the equipment, and maybe the commander.&quot; Because that has worked out so well for him before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Of course, the standings could yet change when the verdicts are passed down in the ongoing match-fixing investigations being conducted in Cremona, Bari and Naples. Fifty-two players and 22 clubs – including Atalanta, Siena and Novara in Serie A – were charged in the sporting trial as part of the former investigation last week (http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/09/italian-football-match-fixing-trial). The expectation is that further individuals and clubs will also be implicated, and a criminal trial may also follow. A glum note to finish the season on, but one that must be faced head on for Italian football to move forwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Catania 0-2 Udinese, Cesena 2-3 Roma, Chievo 1-0 Lecce, Fiorentina 0-0 Cagliari, Genoa 2-0 Palermo, Juventus 3-1 Atalanta, Lazio 3-1 Inter, Milan 2-1 Novara, Napoli 2-1 Siena, Parma 1-0 Bologna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;related&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/juventus&quot;&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/serieafootball&quot;&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/europeanfootball&quot;&gt;European football&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paolobandini&quot;&gt;Paolo Bandini&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;terms&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

         <title>Arsenal confident of deflecting Juventus interest in Robin van Persie</title>

The Dutchman is out of contract in the summer of 2013 and, although he is not agitating for a move, is expected to be offered a four-year contract to remain at the Emirates, a deal that would break the club's current wage structure and include a substantial signing-on fee as Arsenal seek to ensure he does not depart for nothing under the Bosman ruling next summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of major clubs across Europe, including Real Madrid and Barcelona, have been monitoring Van Persie's situation and could test Arsenal's resolve to hold the 28-year-old striker to the final year of his contract this summer. Juventus, who would also expect to compete with Paris St-Germain, Milan and Internazionale, have expressed their admiration for the forward. Giuseppe Marotta, Juve's general director, told the Italian website calciomercato.com: &quot;Van Persie is a great player. He is a complete player and would be useful to any team. But he still has one year left on his contract with Arsenal. We will try to put the icing on the cake this summer but the important thing is that the mix is good.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Persie, who has 30 Premier League goals this term, is not thought to be keen on moving to Italy, with his instinct to remain at Arsenal for at least one more season, encouraged as he has been by the signing of Lukas Podolski from Köln for £10.9m, with the promise of further ambitious transfers to come. Only the tantalising offer of a potential move to either Real or Barça would test that commitment though, even then, the London club would need to sanction any departure given the player remains under contract. That, at present, seems unlikely, with Wenger apparently under no pressure from on high to sell even if Van Persie does not seek to sign new terms at the Emirates stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arsenal manager and Gazidis intend to speak with Van Persie before the start of Euro 2012 – the Holland squad begin their preparations for the tournament late next week – as they continue to plan for next season in the hope that Champions League football will be secured in Sunday's final match at West Bromwich Albion. Interest is retained in the Rennes midfielder Yann M'Vila, though a deal has yet to be agreed with the French club and the player, who has also been courted by Inter. The France international would cost in the region of&amp;nbsp;£17.7m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;related&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/robin-van-persie&quot;&gt;Robin van Persie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsenal&quot;&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/juventus&quot;&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/europeanfootball&quot;&gt;European football&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/transfer-window&quot;&gt;Transfer window&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dominicfifield&quot;&gt;Dominic Fifield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;terms&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But he still has one year left on his contract with Arsenal. We will try to put the icing on the cake this summer but the important thing is that the mix is good.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Persie leads the list of Premier League top scorers with 30 so far this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juventus have also been monitoring Liverpool's Luis Suárez as well as the Real Madrid forward Gonzalo Higuaín.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Van Persie, Suárez or Higuaín? They are three important players,&quot; Marotta said. &quot;In fantasy football we could have the three of them playing in the same line-up but in reality, it is different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If one of them arrives here it is not because he will be the less talented as other things have to be taken into account, such as the financial aspect. Moreover, if [Real Madrid coach] José Mourinho does not want to sell Higuaín it will be impossible for us to get him and we also have to take that into consideration.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;related&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/robin-van-persie&quot;&gt;Robin van Persie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsenal&quot;&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/juventus&quot;&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool&quot;&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/transfer-window&quot;&gt;Transfer window&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/luis-suarez&quot;&gt;Luis Suárez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;terms&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

For a mere £3.99. Our hand hovered, picked up, paused and replaced. The Mill was tempted – so, so tempted – but one deal-breaking factor stood in the way. Embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mill is fairly used to public humilation but the thought of handing over 100 Hits: Rock to the tousle-haired trendy behind the counter, the one pumping out a mixture of Hungarian 1960s jazz, African tribal singing and obscure but presumably important avant-garde punk fusion into the shop for the past hour and standing there while he fishes out all five CDs with a look of unsuppressed disdain on his stubbled features was simply too much. We just didn't have the chutzpah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hats off, then, to Alex McLeish, who clearly does. His first summer transfer target is &lt;strong&gt;Karl&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&quot;100 Hits: Rock&quot; Henry&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Wolves&lt;/strong&gt;. For a man who has made himself about as popular as scrofula with the home fans at Villa Park due to his miserable style of play, that takes some cojones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, &lt;strong&gt;Arsenal&lt;/strong&gt; want to teach Swansea's &lt;strong&gt;Michel Vorm&lt;/strong&gt; the Way of the Buttery Fingers. The Holland international is wanted by Arsène Wenger to provide some competition for Wojciech Szczesny. He'll make room by &lt;strong&gt;flogging&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Manuel Almunia&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;West Ham&lt;/strong&gt; and sending &lt;strong&gt;Lukaz Fabianski&lt;/strong&gt; out on loan to &lt;strong&gt;any club who'll take him&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;West Ham&lt;/strong&gt; will be in need of a new stopper as &lt;strong&gt;Robert Green&lt;/strong&gt; is off to sunny Spain. &lt;strong&gt;Malaga&lt;/strong&gt; want the erstwhile England man to join their Champions League challenge next season and will match his current wages at Upton Park. The Hammers, on the other hand, want him to take a pay cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Juventus&lt;/strong&gt; have drawn up a summer shopping list more optimistic than a &lt;strong&gt;badger in a wig applying for a job as a lingerie model&lt;/strong&gt;. Hatem Ben Arfa, Robin van Persie, Luis Suárez, Carlos Tevez, Salomon Kalou, Raul Meireles and Branislav Ivanovic are all on there, along with milk, teabags and some of those mints with the toffees in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt; want &lt;strong&gt;Colombia international defender Carlos Sanchez&lt;/strong&gt; on a free transfer from Valenciennes and look like they've beaten Udinese and Genoa to the punch. &lt;strong&gt;Stoke&lt;/strong&gt;, meanwhile, want to take &lt;strong&gt;Roman Lukaku&lt;/strong&gt; on a season-long loan from Chelsea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in managerial news, &lt;strong&gt;Roberto Mancini&lt;/strong&gt; is set to get a&lt;strong&gt; new £22m four-year contract&lt;/strong&gt;, Phil Neville is to be offered a job in the England set-up, &lt;strong&gt;Roberto Di Matteo&lt;/strong&gt; will need to win the Champions League to have any chance of bagging &lt;strong&gt;the Chelsea job long-term&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;West Brom&lt;/strong&gt; have met &lt;strong&gt;Claudio Ranieri&lt;/strong&gt;'s Mr 10% to discuss the soon-to-be-vacant manager's job at the Hawthorns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;related&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/aston-villa&quot;&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/wolves&quot;&gt;Wolverhampton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsenal&quot;&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/westhamunited&quot;&gt;West Ham United&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/juventus&quot;&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/johnashdown&quot;&gt;John Ashdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;terms&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Six long years these fans had waited to see Juventus return to the pinnacle of Italian football, yet as time ticked down at Trieste's Stadio Nereo Rocco the thought of having to delay festivities for even one more second was becoming too much. After all the false dawns, the setbacks, the controversies and the collapses since Calciopoli they just wanted it to be over. They wanted to celebrate a Scudetto once more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confirmation that this title was theirs had arrived roughly three minutes before full time, as word filtered through that Maicon had given Internazionale a 4-2 lead in the Milan derby. Few will have fully comprehended the drama unfolding at San Siro, where the Brazilian's jaw-dropping strike from outside the box provided a fitting conclusion to Serie A's barmiest and most entertaining fixture of the season. None will have cared. All that mattered was that victories for both Inter and Juve – 2-0 up against Cagliari – now seemed assured. Those results would make the Bianconeri champions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final whistle unleashed pandemonium in Trieste. Although this was technically an away game for Juventus, they were playing at a venue which is far closer to Turin than to Cagliari's true home in Sardinia – the Isolani having temporarily relocated after their owner Massimo Cellino lost patience with the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://blogs.thescore.com/footyblog/2012/04/11/bandini-when-is-a-home-game-not-a-home-game-ask-cagliari-fans&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;shabby state of the communally owned Stadio Sant'Elia&lt;/a&gt;. In a crowd of roughly 16,000 on Sunday night, Juventus's fans outnumbered those of their nominal hosts by a ratio of 15 to one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those supporters pouring on to the pitch quickly outnumbered Juventus's players by many times that figure. Giorgio Chiellini was mobbed, the player's face a mixture of delirium and faint concern as they launched him, shirtless, time and again into the night sky. In among the madness, a group of fans made off with a camera belonging to Italy's Sky Sport. Others simply stood on the field and held their banners aloft. One bore a picture of the captain, Alessandro Del Piero, along with the simple message: &quot;Thank you for existing&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juventus's players eventually retreated to their dressing room. It was some time before stewards were able to clear out the tunnel of fans and create enough space on the pitch for them to re-emerge and toast their triumph properly – with bottles of champagne bearing the number 30. This will be officially recorded as Juventus's 28th title, but the club continues to reject the Calciopoli verdicts which stripped them of their 2005 and 2006 Scudetti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That much was affirmed – lest the bottles had not been clear enough – by the club's sporting director, Beppe Marotta, at full time, when he said that the club did indeed intend to add a third golden star to the badge on their shirts. The manager, Antonio Conte, had sought to sidestep the issue when he was pressed by reporters at full time, saying: &quot;What number Scudetto is this? Number one, because it's the first I've won as a manager.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If debates over Juventus's third star are certain to rage on for months and years then Conte would prefer it if they could at least be put on hold for a few days, so this success can be celebrated in its own right. Not only have his team claimed their first piece of major silverware since Calciopoli, but they also stand one game away from an unbeaten season. Only two teams have previously achieved such a feat in Serie A – Perugia, who still didn't win the league, in 1978-79 and Milan in 1991-92. Neither was in a 38-game season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juventus's performance in their first campaign under Conte has gone far beyond what anyone could have imagined for a team who had finished seventh in each of their last two seasons. With one game still to play, they have already collected 23 points more than they managed in total last season. They have also reached the final of the Coppa Italia, where they will face Napoli in two weeks' time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of credit to go around. The signing of Andrea Pirlo on a free transfer following his release by Milan will go down as one of the most brilliant pieces of business ever conducted by the club – and one of the Rossoneri's most boneheaded. If the true picture is a little more nuanced, the player not having produced consistent performances of this calibre for some time before his departure from Milan, then his importance to Juventus is undeniable. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.whoscored.com/Regions/108/Tournaments/5/Seasons/3054/Stages/5667/PlayerStatistics/Italy-Serie-A-2011-2012&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;His 13 assists lead the division&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pirlo was not the only astute signing made by Juventus last summer, though, his fellow midfielder Arturo Vidal arriving from Bayer Leverkusen for €10.5m and going on to become the team's key ball-winner, winning more tackles per game (5.4) than anyone else in the division. Mirko Vucinic, signed for €15m from Roma, drove fans to distraction with his selfishness in possession and tendency to disappear from games, yet also scored a string of crucial goals. His was the strike which set Juventus on the way to victory after just six minutes on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than any player, many feel that the key upgrade made last summer might just have been the opening of Juventus Stadium. Pirlo, upon playing in the venue for the first time, expressed the belief that it would be even more intimidating for opposing teams than a packed San Siro – on account of the close &quot;English-style&quot; stands which placed supporters right on top of the pitch. Juventus have collected six more points at home this season than Milan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the true star of the show has undoubtedly been Conte himself. The manager arrived with only a modest CV – he had taken each of Bari and Siena up from Serie B, with an unsuccessful spell at Atalanta inbetween – but the full backing of supporters who believed that as a former captain he would appreciate the significance of the role. He arrived declaring this team &quot;must get used to using the word Scudetto again&quot;, then promptly refused to acknowledge reporters' suggestions that his team even had a shot at the title until the final two months of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conte was similarly swift in dropping his commitment to the 4-2-4 which had served him so well thus far in his managerial career. He had expressed reservations to the board about the signing of Pirlo specifically because the player did not fit the holding midfielder mould required for such a formation, but rather than force square pegs into round holes, he subsequently adjusted his approach. By developing different variations on 4-3-3 and then later 3-5-2 he was able to not only get the best out of his squad but give himself different options to combat varied opponents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the whole squad embraced his ideals of possession football and a relentless high pressing game – with the exception of one or two high-profile players who subsequently found themselves marginalised – his greatest achievements were in the defensive phase. Stephan Lichtsteiner was the only significant addition made to a backline that conceded 47 goals last year, yet this season under Conte Juventus have allowed only 19 – 13 fewer than anyone else in the division. The clean sheet against Cagliari was their 21st of the season – a club record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was a tribute to the renewed form of Gigi Buffon but also the manager, whose faith in Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli at centre-back was such that he was prepared to even ask Chiellini to play out on the left. Each responded with one of the best seasons of their careers, Bonucci proving himself adept not only as a defender but also a distributor of the ball who could help launch his team onto another offensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the campaign, the one knock on this Juventus team was the claim that they did not possess a match-winner such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic who could beat teams on his own even when the rest were performing poorly. Time and again the Swede has dug Milan out of a hole, scoring more league goals (28) than he has ever before in a single season. And yet this is the first season in which Ibrahimovic has failed to finish top of his domestic league since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the final analysis, Juventus did not need a &lt;em&gt;fuoriclasse&lt;/em&gt; like Ibra in their starting XI. They already had one picking the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Talking points&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• So, that derby. Six goals; three penalties – one the result of an absolutely scandalous decision; Júlio César squaring up to Zlatan Ibrahimovic after the award of said penalty and telling him that he was going to miss, before sticking his tongue out and making all manner of bizarre facial expressions; Ibrahimovic then sticking a perfectly struck penalty past César; a 40-yard volley from Wesley Sneijder that had to be pushed out from under the bar; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/maicon-golazo-v-ac-milan-2/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;that goal from Maicon&lt;/a&gt; … oh, and yet more stunning choreography at San Siro: from Milan's supporters poking fun – &quot;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://yfrog.com/o01hiedj&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Seeing you in May is to see another mirage&lt;/a&gt;&quot; – to Inter's &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/FcInterNewsit/status/199207783906816000/photo/1&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;incredible depiction of the Madonnina that covered an entire stand&lt;/a&gt;. The quality may have been mixed – some of the defending, on both sides, was atrocious – but the entertainment was exceptional. All this with a title on the line. What more could you want from a derby?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• This was, incidentally, Massimiliano Allegri's fifth derby in charge of Milan – and in every one he has faced a different Inter manager. The chances of Andrea Stramaccioni hanging around long enough for the next one appear to be increasing rapidly, with the owner Massimo Moratti telling reporters: &quot;I think he can continue [in the job]&quot;. It feels deserved – the team having collected 17 points in eight matches since he arrived, when they had just 41 from 29 before he arrived. The players, also, appear to be on board. &quot;We hope we can continue with him,&quot; said Diego Milito – whose hat-trick took his personal tally to eight goals in as many Milan derbies. &quot;We are working well.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• If an expectation has too often existed in Serie A that teams with nothing left to play for not only could but should roll over in their remaining games, then there have certainly been plenty prepared to buck the trend this season. After Parma dealt Inter's Champions League hopes a blow in the previous round of fixtures, this weekend it was Bologna who knocked Napoli off course with a 2-0 win. Udinese – aided by two red cards dealt to their opponents Genoa – were able to stay on course, moving three points clear of both Napoli and Inter and staying two ahead of Lazio, who won at Atalanta. All four teams can still claim fourth with the right combination of results, but Udinese are the clear favourites –needing just a draw in their final game away to Catania to secure third. It would be hard to overstate the achievement of manager Francesco Guidolin should they succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The one dampener for Udinese was the suggestion from their captain and leading scorer Antonio Di Natale that this may be his last season. &quot;I'm going to play in the European Championships and then stop,&quot; was his brief, unqualified comment to reporters at full-time – and while further clarification is required, it is not unthinkable that he could be considering stepping away from the game at 34. A long-term knee condition has long obliged him to undergo almost constant physio between games, and he expressed concern following &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/apr/15/piermario-morosini-livorno-serie-b-italy&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;the on-pitch death of Livorno's Piermario Morosini&lt;/a&gt; – a close friend of his – about how many games footballers were now being made to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Not a bad weekend for goals, this one. Beyond Maicon's strike, highlights included Lorik &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/atalanta-0-lazio-2/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cana's violent top-corner finish for Lazio&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xqmxl6_siena-parma-0-2-highlights-all-goals-sky-sport-hd-serie-a_sport?search_algo=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sebastian Giovinco's looping 25-yard volley against Siena&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• At the bottom of the table, Lecce's hopes of survival took another blow with a 1-0 defeat at home to Fiorentina, though Genoa's loss the next day means they are still technically able to escape relegation should they win, and the Grifone lose, next week. Encouraging, given the recent climate in Serie A, were the warm send-offs that fans of both Lecce and the already relegated fans gave to their teams, with applause and chants of support at full-time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• And finally … &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/palermo-4-chievo-4/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Only in a week like this could a match like Palermo 4-4 Chievo wind up as an afterthought&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results: &lt;/strong&gt;Atalanta 0-2 Lazio, Bologna 2-0 Napoli, Cagliari 0 - 2 Juventus, Inter 4-2 Milan, Lecce 0-1 Fiorentina, Novara 3-0 Cesena, Palermo 4-4 Chievo, Roma 2-2 Catania, Siena 0-2 Parma,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Udinese 2-0 Genoa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/interactive/2009/jan/08/serie-a-highlights&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;View highlights of Serie A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/serieafootball/tables&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;The latest league table&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;related&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/serieafootball&quot;&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/juventus&quot;&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/europeanfootball&quot;&gt;European football&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paolobandini&quot;&gt;Paolo Bandini&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;terms&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Milan was a very strong adversary. I realised in the run-in that my team still had energy, while they were a bit tired. To finish the league unbeaten would be something historic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unbeaten leaders went into the penultimate round of fixtures with a one-point advantage over Milan and duly saw off Cagliari in Trieste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vucinic opened the scoring with a neat finish in the sixth minute and the points, and a 28th Scudetto, were sealed when Borriello doubled the lead in the 71st minute, three minutes after coming on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Events at San Siro were far more dramatic as Milan fought back from conceding an early goal to Milito to lead 2-1 early in the second half thanks to two goals from Zlatan Ibrahimovic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swede levelled with a penalty a minute before the break, which replays showed should not have been awarded, and scored again a minute after the restart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Milito got his second from the spot in the 52nd minute and the referee gave a third penalty 10 minutes from time which the Argentinian converted to complete his hat-trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Needing to win to take the title race to the final day because of their inferior head-to-head record with Juve, Milan knew the game was up and the Brazilian Maicon compounded their misery when he lashed home a superb fourth from long range in the 87th minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;related&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/serieafootball&quot;&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/europeanfootball&quot;&gt;European football&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/juventus&quot;&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/acmilan&quot;&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;terms&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

With 84 minutes gone on Wednesday night, Juventus were 1-0 up at home to Lecce and set to maintain their three-point lead – effectively four, since they hold the tie-breaker over second-placed Milan – at the top of the table with two games to play. Their 18th-placed guests were yet to take a shot on target and had been playing with 10 men for the best part of 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, a routine backpass from Andrea Barzagli to Gigi Buffon. The goalkeeper, under no immediate pressure, miscontrolled, and in the blink of an eye Andrea Bertolacci stole in to dispossess him &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xqjqmg_juventus-1-1-lecce-02-05-2012-1-1-goal_sport?search_algo=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;and roll the ball into an empty net&lt;/a&gt;. As Juventus Stadium fell into stunned silence, over in Milan San Siro erupted. The &lt;em&gt;Bianconeri&lt;/em&gt; still control their own destiny but, with their rivals beating Atalanta at home, the gap is back down to a single point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That it should be Buffon offering hope to Milan was unlikely indeed. He, along with Andrea Pirlo, has been the star performer of this still unbeaten Juventus side, conceding only one goal in the previous eight games and performing throughout the season at a level beyond anything he had achieved in some years. It was a fact recognised by the fans in Turin, who after a moment's pause retook to singing his name with gusto. Alessandro Del Piero ran back from the front to give him a high five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet the most remarkable aspect of Buffon's blunder was that it still managed not to be the biggest talking point of the night in Serie A. Even the reopening of Italy's most gripping title race since Calciopoli could not distract a nation's attention from the sight of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://t.co/HjbFx0Ty&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a manager throwing punches at one of his own players&lt;/a&gt; in the dugout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little more than half an hour had been played of Fiorentina's match against Novara when Delio Rossi decided to withdraw Adem Ljajic. The Serbian playmaker had been obliged to play out of position up front due to injuries, but nevertheless his performance to that point had been insipid. That Rossi felt compelled to make a change so soon was certainly understandable, given that relegation-threatened Fiorentina were already two goals down at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ljajic, though, was unimpressed – telling the manager exactly what he thought of the decision as he walked to the bench, offering a sarcastic thumbs-up as he did. For Rossi, it was an act of insubordination too far. The manager launched himself at the player, falling into the dugout as he did so, before appearing to throw at least one punch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole incident lasted only a few seconds, the pair separated sufficiently quickly that by the time the referee Antonio Giannoccaro was alerted to the scuffle by his fourth official, Rossi had already returned to the technical area and resumed calling out instructions to his players on the field. The official duly took no action, so Rossi remained in place, taking the team talk at the interval and returning for the second half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will not be back for Fiorentina's match against Lecce at the weekend, however, the team's co-owner Andrea Della Valle informing Rossi at full time that he would be fired. It was an act taken with great regret. &quot;This was the most painful decision of my 10 years in football – Delio Rossi had never done such a thing before in his life,&quot; Della Valle said. &quot;But in the space of just a few seconds, months of stress came pouring out. He was provoked, but not provocation, even a serious one, can justify those few seconds.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been no other option for a club who have always sought under the Della Valles to send out a positive message off the pitch as well as staying competitive on it. A club that have promoted Save the Children in place of a shirt sponsor, and that created the &lt;em&gt;Cartellino Viola&lt;/em&gt; initiative – awarding the teams or players who show the greatest act of fair play each month a purple card, to offset all the reds and yellows we see dished out to the badly behaved. The club were quick to confirm that Ljajic, too, will face punishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fiorentina executive Vincenzo Guerini – who coached at various clubs for more than 20 years before moving into commentary, then taking on his present role – will replace Rossi until the end of the season. Rossi is yet to speak to the press, and it will be fascinating to see if he chooses to do so. His actions on Wednesday were a long way out of character for one of Italy's most good-natured managers. It seems likely that, as Della Valle suggested, his actions were borne out of long-term causes as much as any immediate provocation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's Fiorentina side have developed a reputation as one of the most brattish in recent memory, from Ljajic's apparent lack of application – Rossi's predecessor, Sinisa Mihajlovic, famously accused him of &quot;eating too much Nutella and playing too much PlayStation&quot; – to Alessio Cerci arriving late for training sessions, while the latter's girlfriend has goaded Fiorentina fans after defeats on Facebook. Last season Cerci made headlines after parking his Maserati in a bay reserved for police, then dismissing officers' initial requests that he relocate with a dismissive: &quot;First I'll eat, then I'll move it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key players such as Riccardo Montolivo and Juan Manuel Vargas have performed well below what they are capable of, and the former is now set to join Milan on a free transfer after his contract was allowed to run down. Respect towards Rossi has been lacking, just as it was for Mihajlovic. Shortly before kick-off on Wednesday, Houssine Kharja is reported to have smashed a door before storming out of the stadium upon learning that he had not been selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such behaviour has, in turn, earned the players the contempt of their own supporters. Rossi was cheered enthusiastically by the crowd for his attack on Ljajic, chants of &quot;Delio, give them a kicking&quot; ringing out from the Curva Fiesole. With Fiorentina subsequently recovering from a 2-0 down to snatch a draw that takes them to within a point of safety, many will even have felt that the ends justified the means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a time when such incidents might have been swept under the rug; in 1983-84 &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r4AW_pnsJ0&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pescara's Tom Rosati assaulted Vittorio Cozzella&lt;/a&gt; during a match against Como with far greater gusto than Rossi did Ljajic and not only kept his job but fielded the attacker in his starting lineup the very next week. But although Rossi apologised sincerely to Ljajic, the rest of the team and Della Valle at full time, there could be no such playing down of an incident that had gone viral online long before the match even reached half-time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Italian football it was yet more unwelcome publicity after a fortnight in which &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/apr/23/genoa-ultras-match-suspension-serie-a&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Genoa's players were forced to strip on the pitch by furious Ultras&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/apr/30/champions-league-whistle-lazio-udinese&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lazio's players and directors stormed a pitch&lt;/a&gt; after being duped by a whistle from the stands. With a match-fixing investigation looming, in which significant numbers of top-flight players and teams are implicated, there is much cause for unease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So much so that the nation's best-supported club are struggling to secure top-billing, even as they stand only two games away from becoming the first Italian team ever to go unbeaten over a 38-game season. Just this once, they may be grateful for that fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Talking points&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Juventus's match against Cagliari has been moved to from an afternoon kick-off to an evening one on Sunday – at the club's request – so that it kicks off at the same time as the Milan derby. League authorities were anxious to avoid suggestions of fixture timing affecting the title race, but risk incurring the considerable wrath of Serie A's broadcast partner, Sky. When the TV rights were up for sale in 2009 teams specifically agreed that concurrent kick-offs should only be required on the final week of the season. To flip-flop now has also created a further dilemma over Lecce and Genoa's fixtures. Lecce trail Genoa by three points after the latter beat Cagliari on Wednesday and would like to kick-off at the same time as their relegation rivals this weekend. That, though, creates a more significant logistical headache than Juventus's change – at present Lecce v Fiorentina is scheduled for Saturday, and Udinese-Genoa for Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• As for Milan, their fans were just relieved to discover that the message flashing up on the scoreboard announcing Lecce's equaliser was correct, unlike the one (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/15833050&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;noted below the line by quidellini&lt;/a&gt;) that claimed Cesena had equalised against them a week earlier. Theirs was another confident victory over Atalanta, and if Massimiliano Allegri's words at full time had been uttered by Sir Alex Ferguson, they would most certainly have been classified as mind games. &quot;The last 15 minutes were like being at the theatre waiting for the final act of an opera,&quot; the manager said. &quot;Five minutes from the end it seemed as though it was all over. Now, not so much.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The race for third, meanwhile, may be back down to two after Lazio drew at home to Siena and Inter lost at Parma. The latter represents Andrea Stramaccioni's first defeat and, if there is no shame in losing to a Parma side who have won five of their past six games, then the manner with which Inter threw away the game provided a reminder of how they wound up so far off the pace in the first place. Having taken the lead through Wesley Sneijder, they seemed in control before Lúcio gifted Parma a soft equaliser while trying to dribble away from Sebastian Giovinco on the edge of his own area. Two minutes later Inter were trailing after again giving away possession cheaply. &quot;We'll do the sums at the end,&quot; Stramaccioni said afterwards. &quot;In any case, nobody has told me that the Europa League would be such a disaster.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Napoli and Udinese did each collect three points – beating Palermo and Cesena respectively. For Udinese that meant they had won consecutive Serie A fixtures for the first time since December. There were some disappointing words from Antonio Di Natale, however, disagreeing with the recent comments by Cesare Prandelli, the Italy manager, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/italy-coach-prandelli-urges-gay-players-come-out-3110741&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;in support of gay footballers&lt;/a&gt; wanting to come out. &quot;I respect and like the manager, but I do not agree with him,&quot; said Di Natale. &quot;I am against the idea of going public with such an important decision. How would the fans react?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Catania 0-1 Bologna, Cesena 0-1 Udinese, Chievo 0-0 Roma, Fiorentina 2-2 Novara, Genoa 2-1 Cagliari, Juventus 1-1 Lecce, Lazio 1-1 Siena, Milan 2-0 Atalanta, Napoli 2-0 Palermo, Parma 3-1 Inter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&amp;CTID=13&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Latest Serie A table&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/interactive/2009/jan/08/serie-a-highlights&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watch the latest Serie A highlights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;related&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/serieafootball&quot;&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fiorentina&quot;&gt;Fiorentina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/juventus&quot;&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/europeanfootball&quot;&gt;European football&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paolobandini&quot;&gt;Paolo Bandini&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;terms&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2012 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

<td valign="top">Juventus were left to rue their misfortune after failing to reap the rewards from a dominant performance in Genova. Antonio Conte’s men shrugged off their critics by showing a strong attacking display against a spirited Genoa outfit. Vucinic and Pepe both rattled the woodwork before the winger had a perfectly good goal ruled out for offside.Conte was forced into a further defensive reshuffle after Bonucci’s sending off in Bologna. Vidal dropped back to partner Caceres at the heart of the Bianconeri rearguard, while Giaccherini stepped into the Chilean’s position on the right of the midfield three. Matri, who scored twice the first time the sides met this season, was preferred to Borriello up front.The supporters inside the Luigi Ferraris had barely taken their seats before the hosts carved out their first opportunity. Palacio scampered through on goal but found Buffon alert to deny him his fifteenth goal of the season.Juve’s response, however, was instant. Pepe’s low strike drew a save from Frey minutes later, while Marchisio’s saw his forward burst picked out by Vucinic shortly afterwards, only for the midfielder to steer his shot directly at the French shot-stopper.The Montenegrin, buoyed by his midweek equaliser against Bologna, was the undisputed star of the first half, dropping deep to good effect and looking to bring others into play with his unselfish approach.
<p>Yet the Bianconeri had to remain alert to the threat posed by Genoa, a side who have enjoyed a strong record on home soil this season. And the hosts almost put themselves in the driving seat when Gilardino collected with Biondini’s cross, only for the striker to send his header skywards.</p>
<p>Juventus carved out two more opportunities before the interval. Pirlo lined up a free-kick but looped his effort over the bar. Vucinic then played in Matri, who saw his goalbound strike blocked by Rossi’s sliding challenge.</p>
<p>The restart yielded a similar shape to the game, with the visitors consistently committing men forward whilst raising the tempo. And the Bianconeri almost saw their hard work pay off seven minutes after the interval, when Vucinic rose highest in the area to connect with Pirlo’s corner and glance a header onto the crossbar.</p>
<p>Provider went close to turning goalscorer moments later, with Frey proving equal to Pirlo’s rasping strike from distance. Again Juventus piled on the pressure and Vucinic was unlucky to see his header cannon back off the post, before Pepe also hit the upright after timing his late arrival to perfection.</p>
<p>Sensing an opportunity on the counter, the Rossoblu lifted their heads and drove forward. Kaladze caused a moment of panic when he was found unmarked at the back post, but Buffon again responded positively to the defender’s effort, parrying the left-footed strike away from danger.</p>
<p>The main talking point of the game arrived midway through the second half. Pepe thought he had given Juve the lead after stealing in to tap home at the back post, only to see the linesman’s flag raised for a contentious offside. This proved to be the winger’s last contribution as Dutch winger Elia came on to operate down the right flank.</p>
<p>As the game wore on, Del Piero and Borriello came on in place of Matri and Giaccherini to add some fresh legs to the Bianconeri strikeforce, yet the visitors were unable to snatch the goal their attacking display more than merited.</p>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>This is a very bittersweet moment. For years, the <em>Juventus Offside</em> name has been synonymous with the best English-speaking blog about all things Juventus (at least for me). While that description will stay the same, we will now continue the epicness of this community under a new name and new website.</p>
<p>Without further ado, the trio of writers here at the Offside would like to introduce to you:</p>
<p align="center" style="font-size:14pt;margin:15px 0 15px 0;"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.blackwhitereadallover.com"><strong>BlackWhiteReadAllOver.com</strong></a></p>
<p>As you all know, we&#8217;ve been expecting this switch to SB Nation for a while now and we finally got word tonight that everything has been transferred (well, almost everything, looks like <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://juventus.theoffside.com/team-news/italjuve-meets-stars-stripes.html">John&#8217;s last post</a> hasn&#8217;t made it yet). </p>
<p>The name of the new website was chosen by John &amp; Aaron (when Aaron was still a writer here). I was at first hesitant about it, but after a few visits to the site I have to admit that I like it &#8211; it&#8217;s quite catchy. </p>
<p>While you all head to the new domain and register/become a fan of the blog, I&#8217;d love to take some time and reminisce on some of the best moments we&#8217;ve had here, on the Juventus Offside.</p>
<p><b>So, what was your favorite/most memorable moment at the Juve Offside?</b></p>
<p>I can easily tell you mine. It actually wasn&#8217;t flashy or anything. There were many more generally memorable moments at the Offside, but this particular one I remember easily. It was in fact what made me realize that this blog is pretty cool.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t quite remember what the topic of conversation was, but as always there was a debate in the comment section about one player or another. It was like the third or fourth time I had come to the site, so I was pretty new (though very opinionated, as always). In the midst of the discussion, I threw up a comment saying the writers of the blog should put up a poll for all Juventus Offside fans to settle the argument once and for all.</p>
<p>The next day, I come to the site and voila &#8211; Aaron has a quick write up about this great idea that a fan had in the comments, followed by the poll question we were all discussing. There were like 200 votes on it already.</p>
<p>That was the exact moment when I realized that this wasn&#8217;t a website with a snobby distinction of Writers and Commenters. Everyone was pretty close to equal &#8211; everyone&#8217;s opinion mattered the same, especially if expressed eloquently. It didn&#8217;t matter if it was buried in the comments or officially posted by the writers &#8211; people paid attention to what was being said and kept on discussing. That example, the religious following, and frequent guest posts on the site further solidified my high opinion of the Offside as a community of Juventini. </p>
<p>It is truly a pleasure being a part of this online Juve gang, and I am looking forward to continuing the conversation with all of you at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.blackwhitereadallover.com"><strong>Black &amp; White &amp; Read All Over</strong></a>.</p>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s focus on the coming days. Pretty soon we&#8217;ll have to face two matches in four days, two extremely important moments in our season, the first one against Chievo at home, the second one is against Bologna to recuperate the match called off because of the snow storm.</p>
<p>Just think about it.. it&#8217;s been quite a long time since we were running for two targets in March, Italia Cup and Championship, as you  know we&#8217;ll be playing the second leg match against Milan that is something like Olympic finals.</p>
<p>March is about to start and our future will be pretty much written during this month, so we have to give our best to start it in the best way ever. This is all we are focused at now.</p>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Regardless of which club you watch in Europe, every few weeks, per international rules, comes a break in the action of your beloved team.  Sometimes it&#8217;s a fixture which actually means something &#8212; a World or regional cup qualifier, specifically &#8212; but often it&#8217;s a simple friendly.  You know how they are.  A glorified Sunday morning, local-park, pickup game, with virtually unlimited subs, indifferent coaches, and barely coherent fans, a typical chance for &#8220;experimentation&#8221; (unless you&#8217;re Marcello Lippi, ca 2009-10).</p>
<p>Today, however, the two bulls will collide when Italian National Team will face off against the United States Men&#8217;s National Team.  Just another pit-stop en route to Poland/Ukraine, you say?  Well, yes, it is.  For me, however, it&#8217;s a bit more.  And that&#8217;s aside from the <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>seven</strong></span> (7) Juventus players called up by Italy coach Cesare Prandelli.  It&#8217;s a bit more personal.  And difficult.</p>

<p><span id="more-7538"></span>I grew up the son of Italian immigrants at a time where &#8220;US Soccer&#8221; was an oxymoron.  As a child, Sundays consisted not of football but rather <em>futbol</em>, or more accurately <em>calcio</em>.  To write that I felt like an outcast for being unable to participate in discussions regarding the NFL standings on Monday mornings would imply that I cared about them at the time.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I always had a healthy appreciation for baseball, and football would follow.  For my childhood house, however, soccer was king, but it was all Italian.  Rai was part of the basic cable package, and Serie A was the strongest league in the world.  At age 7, Italy hosted the first World Cup that I can remember.  And although that would mark the first time during my own lifetime that the country of my parents&#8217; birth would face off against the country of my own (and result in another victory for Italy), I have no memories of that game.  Instead, the images of Diego Maradona&#8217;s Argentina eliminating Italy in penalties in Naples are my only memories from that World Cup.</p>
<p>And, that&#8217;s about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It would be another two years until the two teams would face off again.  I wasn&#8217;t there, but a few days earlier I watched my first ever live international game.  My dad and my uncles drove my brother and I up to Connecticut to watch <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_U.S._Cup#May_31:_Italy_vs_Portugal">Italy play Portugal</a>, a country which I was surprised to learn wasn&#8217;t in the Caribbean.  Actually, I still have the Italian flag that my uncle Gennaro bought me that day.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A few days later, John Harkes would cancel out Roberto Baggio &#8212; a man who two years later would serve as my childhood idol again on American soil &#8212; and the United States would crown themselves champions of the inaugural &#8221;US Cup,&#8221; in the rich American tradition of inventing one&#8217;s own competitions in order to win them (<em>see</em> football, American).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In the intervening years, there would be no meaningful interactions between the two countries and certainly, no rivalry.  Italy would continue its steady course of clinical, tactical, near-cynical play, while hovering around the apex of the world&#8217;s teams.  The United States would continue to grow more into the sport, far beyond the point to which its very name attached to the sport was no longer considered &#8220;oxymoronic,&#8221; if not still a bit of a joke.  The U.S. got better and better, <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">slowly </span>and rather quickly, and has come a long way since.  It&#8217;s also since plateaued.  The US is certainly not at the point that matches its hype prior to the 2006 World Cup, when it was absurdly ranked 4th in the World &#8212; although it&#8217;s at a tipping point now.  Years of over-hype, mixed with mediocrity threaded with flashes of overachieving have taken it to a point where it&#8217;s at a crossroads.  There&#8217;s a fork in the road: remain stagnant, or progress.  The Federation is perhaps hoping that a shiny new European coach with a European pedigree can get them over the hump.  Here&#8217;s hoping to the latter, I guess.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">As far as I&#8217;m concerned, I&#8217;m sort of stuck in this no-man&#8217;s land.  I&#8217;ve traditionally rooted for the United States in head-to-head matchups.  It&#8217;s a weird dichotomy I&#8217;ve created in my mind, sort of like my defense-mechanism of choice &#8212; the sarcastic humor / constant facetious behavior which I&#8217;ve dug myself into since adolescence.  I remember the 1994 World Cup, in which the USA qualified by default.  That opening weekend, they faced off against Switzerland, and I can still remember watching that 1-1 draw in my living room.  Meanwhile, Italy would be horribly upset by Ireland in my own backyard, Giants Stadium.  However, Italy would go onto the finals, and I would follow them the rest of the way.  Way more passionately and painfully than the former team.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">2006 was no different, only that marked the next time the two sides would meet.  Again, it was weirder than kissing your cousin.  Arguably knowing more about the Italian team, I felt this strange compulsion towards the United States.  That game ended 1-1, and both teams would go onto their last game in group stage with something to prove.  When finally the US would go onto lose to Ghana I turned and said to my friend Paul, as we sat watching on TV from his deck in his backyard &#8212; &#8220;well, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://juventus.theoffside.com/team-news/afarewell-to-mixed-feelings.html">I can root for Italy now</a> in peace&#8221;  &#8211; as if some burden was lifted off my shoulders.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I want the United States to do well.  I really do.  Perhaps it&#8217;s because I was born here, and have a sense of gratitude towards the country my parents came to in order to improve their lives and my own.  Perhaps it&#8217;s because I love soccer, and I am still holding out hope that a quality product will eventually make its way within driving distance, and not just once every 20-or so years, but in a regular, seasonal format.  I&#8217;ve thought it was perhaps a product of the &#8220;children of 9/11 syndrome&#8221; which I&#8217;ve theorized about, at times when feeling intellectual.  However, I was a month shy of 19 when that happened, and my US-Soccer-centricism far predates that.  The truth is, I root for US soccer over Italy without actually preferring the US better.  Not its style, players, or history.  It&#8217;s irrational, but at least I can admit it.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">And then, when it&#8217;s time for the European Cup, I feel happy that I can enjoy Italy, my <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">mistress</span> first love, without any guilt.  When it&#8217;s World Cup time and unlike in 1990 or 2006, the two teams pass like ships in the night , I can ignore that they both exist in the same stratosphere, while simply watching each as if they both exist exclusively in a vacuum &#8212; one secretly loved more than the other, like the older child with all the trophies on the mantle.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">But, when they play each other, I feel like <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bigblueview.com/2010/9/15/1688243/manning-bowl-ii-this-time-its-a"><strong>Archie Manning</strong> watching the <strong>Indianapolis Colts</strong> and the <strong>New York Giants</strong></a> (led by two-time Super Bowl Champion/MVP <strong>Eli Manning</strong><strong>, by the way</strong>) play each other.  It&#8217;s fun, but it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">And yet, I feel as if it&#8217;s a bit worse for me.  My cousin grew up with Giuseppe Rossi.  Their families remain friends to this day.  To my family, I&#8217;m an Americentric pseudo-intellectual with the habits of a neanderthal, in regards to soccer &#8212; sorry, calcio &#8212; at least.  I just don&#8217;t get it, I&#8217;m naive, blah blah blah blah blah, Italy is the best, and the US is inferior.  And far more so to them than they actually are.  I get the sense that they&#8217;re afraid the United States will ever be close to being as good as its fans think it is.  Because then it&#8217;s something, nay, the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">one</span> thing that they have over this great, big, colossal country of mine, that they&#8217;d no longer have anymore.  Even though they live here too.  Weird.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">To my US Soccer fan friends, I&#8217;m a Eurosnob, an apologist for a diving, cheating, whining team, resented by them because most of their followers around<em> these them here parts</em> (present company excluded) are generations removed from the old country.  Oh, right, I nearly forgot to mention &#8212; according to US Soccer fans, whenever your team loses to another team with a superior talent pool, built upon years of superior coaching staffs and thus tactics, tradition, etc., it&#8217;s <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">almost</span> always the fault of the referees, and/or the players on the other team cheating in some form or fashion, both in which obviously go hand in hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Anyway, I&#8217;m not generations-removed like most &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mtv.com/shows/jersey_shore/season_5/series.jhtml">Italians</a>&#8221; around here as I&#8217;m a first-generation, but that&#8217;s virtually ignored.  Oh well.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I simply can&#8217;t win.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">And I won&#8217;t be able to tomorrow either.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Oh yea, this is a Juventus blog.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.football-italia.net/node/16154">Tomorrow, 7 1/2 of our guys have been called up</a>.  Buffon, Barzagli, Bonucci, Chiellini, Marchisio, Pirlo, and Matri.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The remaining half is being represented by Sebastian Giovinco, both by ownership rights and physical stature.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">ItalJuve versus <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77gKSp8WoRg&amp;ob=av2e">my hometown</a>.  AKA, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://italy.worldcupblog.org/italy/preview-italy-usa.html">Giuseppe RossiLand</a>.</p>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally, a game reminiscent of the good old Serie A that we were accustomed to watching ~10 years ago. A game of two titans, two top sides going against each other in what was going to be a near-Scudetto decider. And while the score at the end decided nothing, the game had everything: good football, great drama, multiple controversies, referee mistakes, violent plays, and most importantly, two goals on each side to cancel it all out.</p>
<p>Having played once recently in Coppa Italia (a game at San Siro which Juve won 2-1), the two teams were no strangers to each other. It was, however, the coaches pre-game set up that had the most influence on how the game went on for most of the 90 minutes.</p>
<p><img src="http://l.yimg.com/j/assets/p/sp/getty/5f/fullj.14872038c6f78abddceaff0a39bbf822/14872038c6f78abddceaff0a39bbf822-getty-509152039.jpg" alt="Juventus Buffon Milan" width="650"/></p>
<p><span id="more-7522"></span></p>
<p>Despite being very successful with his preferred 4-2-4/4-3-3 formation early in the season, Conte has been relying on his 3-5-2 formation to nullify threats from rival teams when playing away from home this season (e.g. vs Udinese and Napoli). Borriello and Quagliarella started the game as the main strikers much to the surprise by many, especially with the prolific form Alessandro Matri has been in lately. I assume Conte wanted to use his strongest strikers that play with their backs to the goal since Milan&#8217;s center-backs are some of the strongest in Serie A this year.</p>
<p><strong>FIRST HALF</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Allegri and the AC Milan players were very well positioned in midfield/attack and were able to take full advantage of Conte&#8217;s 3-5-2 set up in the first 45 minutes. One particular problem,<strong> taking the ball out the back under pressure</strong>, has been a recurring theme for Juventus this season and Conte has yet to find a valid solution to it.</p>
<p>Ever since the beginning of the season, it was clear that Conte wanted the ball played out from defense and played on the ground. In too many cases, however, our poor-passing centre backs have only Pirlo to pass to when getting the ball forward. Unless one of them finds space to push the ball up the field (rare and scary, especially when Bonucci&#8217;s or Chiellini&#8217;s does it), the rest of our midfield does a poor job getting back and providing passing options for our shaky defenders. This often results in either a poor pass from our centre backs, or a mistake by Pirlo, who by the time he receives the ball and turns is surrounded by multiple opposing players. Here&#8217;s a quick example of that in the beginning of the game against Milan:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/H7IeL.jpg" alt="Juventus Defensive positioning" width="650"/></p>
<p>Teams have learned this flaw in Conte&#8217;s possession-style formations and are quick to exploit it with high pressing in the early stages of the game. One would expect for the rest of our MVP midfield to drop deeper and provide support for outlet passes, but Vidal and Marchisio have been slow to recognize this or, later in the games, too tired to make the extra run back and help kick-start the attack. Milan on the other hand, did this much better on Saturday:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DijTi.jpg" alt="Milan Defensive positioning" width="650"/></p>
<p>It was no surprise then to see Bonucci gift a pass in his own third of the field to the Milan players, who quickly ran at Juve&#8217;s defense and scored the opening goal on 15 minutes (off of Bonucci&#8217;s deflection at that).</p>
<p>The rest of the first half was dominated by Milan as they pressed high, were better organized, and had Robinho, who was a nightmare for our defense for most of the game. Quagliarella and Borriello failed to provide the type of target-man service in attack, and were often muscled out by Milan&#8217;s defenders. Milan even managed to score a second goal 25 minutes in, but Buffon scrambled the ball away before the referee could comprehend what happened and the goal was not given. More on that later.</p>
<p><strong>SECOND HALF</strong></p>
<p>As our Juventus Offside comment section was reeling and Twitter was blowing up asking Conte to make changes at the half, it looked like Conte had finally switched his 3-5-2 to a more natural 4-3-2-1 with the introduction of Pepe over the disappointing Estigarribia at the 46 minute mark. Pepe took his familiar position as a right winger, Quagliarella now played the attacking left winger position Vucinic usually occupies, while Chiellini and Lichsteiner settled in more natural full back positions. The change in formation and attitude was complete when Vucinic entered the game in Marco Borriello&#8217;s place on the 52 minute mark, adding a bit of desperately needed flair to an attack that was stagnant and unoriginal for most of the game.</p>
<p>Milan was still the dominant side on the pitch, but the change in character from the Juventus players was becoming more evident as the half went on. The last spark was Alessandro Matri, Juve&#8217;s leading goalscorer this season who replaced Quagliarella in the 70th minute and was instantly dangerous, scoring a goal that was falsely ruled offside by the same linesman who didn&#8217;t see Muntari&#8217;s goal earlier in the game.</p>
<p>Matri was not to be denied a second time, however, as he took a delicious Pepe cross on the volley and slotted home for the game-tying goal on 83 minutes. Juve&#8217;s resurgence in the second half had finally paid off, what due to Milan&#8217;s fatigue after pressing and pushing for most of the game, what due to Conte&#8217;s change of tactics and attitude.</p>
<p><img src="http://l.yimg.com/j/assets/p/sp/getty/ef/fullj.b868d2aa509e591a98b3a916c6e2060f/b868d2aa509e591a98b3a916c6e2060f-getty-509154851.jpg" alt="Juventus Matri Milan" width="650"/></p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Did Juve deserve to win this game? Hell no. I&#8217;d even go as far as to say that Milan deserved to win, but one thing I&#8217;ve learned from watching football all these years is that you play until the final whistle and anything can happen.</p>
<p>What is more important, in my opinion, is what kind of attitude will these two teams come out with after this game. I believe Milan feels encouraged yet angry &#8211; they played well but didn&#8217;t get the 3 points. Now they have more games ahead (unless Arsenal pulls off a miracle comeback) and are still technically behind (Juve have a game in hand). On the other hand, i Bianconeri are certainly not celebrating this point too much. Our team has obvious gaps and weaknesses and little time to fix them. Conte will have to work hard in these next few weeks to find a way to score more goals and be more threatening in attack.  More importantly, after enjoying a positive run at the beginning of the season, many of our players have dipped in both dedication and grinta on the field. That has to change if we are to mount a serious Scudetto challenge.</p>
<p><strong>CONTROVERSY </strong></p>
<p>Almost 2 days after the game, and there is still plenty of talk and discussion about all the controversy involved in this game. It&#8217;d be very easy to get drawn into it. Instead, let&#8217;s try to objectively look at what is fact and what is opinion. Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>Facts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Milan scored two legitimate goals in the first half. Only one was given.</li>
<li>Juventus scored two legitimate goals in the second half. Again, only one was given.</li>
<li>Vidal deserved his red card for his tackle on Van Bommel.</li>
<li>Mexes intentionally <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=UzWYGuAuf8A">punched Borriello in the stomach</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Controversies/Opinions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mexes deserved a red card for punching Borriello in the stomach</li>
<li>Muntari deserved a card for <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urJ-uHJUsm0">retaliating violently</a> to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://l.yimg.com/j/assets/p/sp/getty/9c/fullj.46919e1b09ff7bd2baffbbb53b2acb56/46919e1b09ff7bd2baffbbb53b2acb56-getty-509156144.jpg">Lichsteiner&#8217;s defense</a></li>

<p>Good, we got all that out of the way.</p>
<p>Now, what did all of those incidents mean? Well, the two disqualified goals cancel each other out. Any sane Milan fan will agree to at least that. Now, does the second goal Muntari score change the game? Of course it does. How? No one knows. It&#8217;s easy to say that Juventus are screwed and they definitely lose the game cuz of the 2-0 early lead. What is definitely true, is that it would be harder to come back from a 2-0 lead than a 1-0 lead (simple logic). But Juventus have come back from 2-0 down before this season&#8230;and it was against a top table team as well. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://juventus.theoffside.com/team-news/juventus-3-3-napoli-second-half-soldiers.html">Just ask Napoli</a>. I&#8217;m not saying that would&#8217;ve happened again, but I&#8217;m not saying it wouldn&#8217;t have, either.</p>
<p>Is there a bigger conspiracy at hand here? My opinion is a definite <strong>no</strong>. Many are quick to jump to mocking conclusions in the style of &#8220;Moggi this, Berlusconi that&#8221;. But in all seriousness, the refs just screwed up. Twice. And big time. Fortunately, it all evened out at the end. I am really curious to see how many games suspension Mexes receives (if any). If he doesn&#8217;t, I would definitely entertain any conspiracy theories. That&#8217;s a clear red card per review.</p>
<p>In summary of the controversy, Conte put it best: &#8220;&#8230;<span style="color:#333333;font-family:verdana, arial;font-size:12px;line-height:16px;"> this game was fired up too much by everyone, both those within it and outside of it. The atmosphere in my view was not good for sport. It’s a shame, but the match is decided within the pitch and too many things happened this week.&#8221; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.football-italia.net/node/16065">source</a>)</span></p>
<p>It feels like the same thing is happening now after the game as well. Gotta love Serie A <img src='http://juventus.theoffside.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley'/> </p>
<p><img src="http://l.yimg.com/j/assets/p/sp/getty/1d/fullj.d75363dd58d142c7f2f80d2ab5a4f73c/d75363dd58d142c7f2f80d2ab5a4f73c-getty-509156090.jpg" alt="Juventus Milan Controversy Fight" width="650"/></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">LE PAGELLE:</span></p>
<p><strong>Buffon</strong>: 7 &#8211; Buffon is a big game player, there&#8217;s no doubt about that. Had no chance on the first goal, and reacted amazingly and swiftly to make sure Mexes&#8217; header didn&#8217;t go in and Muntari&#8217;s didn&#8217;t count. Was also super quick to react to any on-rushing balls and runs by the Milan players. Very, very solid performance by our keeper. Too bad the lads in front of him couldn&#8217;t do the same.</p>
<p><strong>Barzagli: </strong>6 &#8211; If there is one guy who benefits from the 3-man defense it&#8217;s Barzagli. His lack of pace is usually balanced out by Bonucci&#8217;s tracking nearby, though Andrea doesn&#8217;t quite possess the technical ability to play as a quasi right back at times when taking the ball up the field. He did a much better job stepping out in front of Milan&#8217;s strikers in the second half.</p>
<p><strong>Bonucci:</strong> 4.5 &#8211; Man, was that brutal to watch. Leonardo had one solid interception in the first 10 minutes, and everything just went downhill from there. He lost the ball on several key occasions, one leading to Nocerino&#8217;s goal, and was totally out of the game for most of it. If the 3-man defense made sense when he was playing decent, it now makes absolutely no sense. Bonucci needs to sit down for a few games, and get his chance again against a smaller team in Torino to get his confidence back. He&#8217;s definitely not one for the big games. Shame.</p>
<p><strong>Chiellini: </strong>5.5 &#8211; I was personally a bit disappointed with Chiellini for most of the game. As the third-in-line captain (at least in my head it&#8217;s ADP&gt;Buffon&gt;Chiellini), he did little to lead the defense out of the early game slump. Instead, he settled for deep positions, gave up space and waited for Robinho and Emmanuelson to attack, and was a follower instead of a leader in the team for most of the game. He did improve in the second half and was a lot more of a presence on both sides of the field, but overall I look for him to lead our defense, especially when he has a young kid like Bonucci alongside him. </p>
<p><strong>Lichtsteiner:</strong> 6 &#8211; A quiet game by the Swiss&#8217; standards, but you cannot put all the blame on him. While not a natural wing back, he did relatively well in the first half, providing width and crossing in attack. Was a bit more of himself defensively in the second when Pepe was in front of him as a winger.</p>
<p><img src="http://l.yimg.com/j/assets/p/sp/getty/3a/fullj.2366ffdf77b3bc364a5b8ffae940e163/2366ffdf77b3bc364a5b8ffae940e163-getty-509152843.jpg" alt="Juventus Milan Lichsteiner Antonini" width="650"/></p>
<p><strong>Pirlo: </strong>6 &#8211; I thought Allegri&#8217;s decision to not man-mark Pirlo was an interesting one. Too bad the ever-talented midfielder couldn&#8217;t make the most out of the space he had at times. He even misplaced some simple passes and his touch just wasn&#8217;t there during the game. In all fairness, he rarely got much help from Marchisio and Vidal, and even less from the forwards early on. Could&#8217;ve and should&#8217;ve done better though. Look for him to step it up after the international break. Our Scudetto challenge will depend on him greatly, and he is too great of a player not to step up to the challenge (pun&#8230;not&#8230;intended?)</p>
<p><strong>Vidal: </strong><strong>5.5</strong> &#8211; My man of the match in the first half, though I&#8217;m sure many of you would disagree. Still, he was the only one playing with fire, with determination in the first half. In the second, he tired and even got injured. Then, his hustle turned into chaos (as it often does) and he made a reckless challenge on Van Bommel for a red card. Overall though, I thought he had a decent game. If he starts playing a bit deeper, he&#8217;d be able to get more touches and get into the game more. We need his South American flair desperately.</p>
<p><strong>Marchisio:</strong> 5.5 &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t even tell Marchisio was playing until 10 minutes into the second half. What has happened to the difference-maker of the first part of the season? He needs to be the source of energy, the spark that wakes up the Vucinices and Borriello&#8217;s of our team. Instead, he was lost in the shuffle for most of the game. Played way too high to get any good link-ups with Pirlo, tho not far enough to be a threat to Milan&#8217;s goal. Another very disappointing performance.</p>
<p><strong>Estigarribia: </strong>5.5 -Why on earth did this guy start in the toughest match to date this season? And as a wing back at that? Huge mistake by Conte. Esti needs to work on many aspects of his game, mainly defensive positioning, running with the ball, and crossing. Had a decent shot after Muntari&#8217;s not-goal, which saved him from a 5. Yay.</p>
<p><strong>Quagliarella:</strong> 5.5 &#8211; I promise you I&#8217;m not just giving everyone 5.5 cuz I&#8217;m lazy. Really, Quagliarella had a very insignificant game. Was marked out for the majority of the first half and failed to make a difference by dropping deeper to get the ball. He had one big chance in the second half and he scuffed a shot at goal from 5 metres straight at Abbiatti. I was furious. I&#8217;ve calmed down since. But man, he wants to be a clinical striker, that&#8217;s his chance. And don&#8217;t be grabbing your leg like it&#8217;s cramping after missing a big chance like that! </p>
<p><strong>Borriello: </strong>5 &#8211; Next to Estigarribia, another inexplicable selection by Conte. Borriello is useless. There is nothing he can do better than any of our other strikers. Without getting into why we bought him in the first place, he had no reason being on the field at all on Saturday. He even managed to prove that himself.</p>
<p>Subs:</p>
<p><strong>Pepe:</strong> 7 &#8211; Revitalized our team and put in some great-looking crosses. Was an obvious sub choice and I was very glad to see him come on right at halftime. Great assist to Matri for the goal too.</p>
<p><strong>Vucinic: </strong>6 &#8211; It was tough for Mirko to get into the game, especially since he&#8217;s not a big game player. Did well to stretch the field a bit, but was mostly ineffective. Just didn&#8217;t look up for it. There was talk that he got in an argument with Conte about running laps after the Catania game, but I doubt that&#8217;s what kept him out of performing against Milan. Even he must have more brains than that, right?</p>
<p><strong>Matri: </strong> 7.5 &#8211; MA-TA-TA-TA-TA-TA-TRIIIII! Yeah, you yelled it when he scored, and you know it. It was awesome. He came in, scored a couple goals, tied the game in both scoring and controversies, and salvaged a point. Grazie Alessandro!</p>
<p>Coach:</p>
<p><strong>Conte: </strong>6  &#8211; Got things horribly wrong at the beginning, and faced an uphill race all night. The choices of Esti and Borriello were a rookie mistake, and we already discussed his wrongfully preferred starting formation. Nonetheless, he realized his mistake at halftime and tried his best to change things up. Matri saved his ass with the energy and goals he brought when coming on, but this still is one of Conte&#8217;s worst games as a Juventus manager. Gotta give him this though &#8211; he has defined a Juventus character this year that was missing in years past. If it weren&#8217;t for that team character, we would have never come back from going down against Napoli or Milan. The biggest test of that character will be when our first defeat comes. Something tells me he/we&#8217;d bounce back strong.</p>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ghanaian looked to have scored a perfectly-legitimate goal 10 minutes after Antonio Nocerino&#8217;s early opener, as the ball was shown to have crossed the line despite Gianluigi Buffon&#8217;s best efforts to clear the effort, but the linesman deemed that it wasn&#8217;t a goal.</p>
<p>However, Matri also had a valid goal of his own chalked off for offside near the end of the encounter, and he believes the two incidents have cancelled each other out in a bid to defuse tensions after the match.</p>
<p>&#8220;My disallowed goal? It ties us with AC Milan, as I have said [Muntari's header] to be a regular goal,&#8221; the 27-year-old <em>Sky Sport Italia</em>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Matri managed to salvage a draw for Juventus late on and preserve their unbeaten start to the campaign, much to the relief of the striker, who reckons the point may not be decisive in the title race, but important for team morale as the business end of the season approaches.</p>
<div id="ad160x600">&#8220;It was important we were able to equalise in such a difficult match. It&#8217;s a draw that makes a difference in the league table, but not one that will be decisive in the race for the title.</div>
<p>&#8220;[The result] also keeps our momentum going, which for us is the most important thing,&#8221; he concluded.</p>
<p>Juventus remain in second place and one point behind Milan at the Serie A summit, but have a game in hand over their rivals.</p>]]></content:encoded>

         <description>Well, for the first time this season, I can honestly say that Juventus were outplayed, and didn&amp;#8217;t deserve to win.  But that&amp;#8217;s why you play 90 minutes of soccer football.  A couple of thoughts:

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-7516  aligncenter" src="http://juventus.theoffside.com/files/2012/02/fight.jpg" alt="68668033" width="610" height="402"/></p>
<p>Well, for the first time this season, I can honestly say that Juventus were outplayed, and didn&#8217;t deserve to win.  But that&#8217;s why you play 90 minutes of <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">soccer</span> football.  A couple of thoughts:</p>
<p><strong>Adriano Galliani -</strong> really?  Didn&#8217;t you say that it&#8217;s unbecoming of a big team to complain about the referees.  If reports that at halftime you screamed at the referees are true, then isn&#8217;t that just the definition of hypocrisy.  Your post-match comments alone made you look small.  Practice what you preach.</p>
<p>Conte wasn&#8217;t a saint himself, but he apologized at least.  Passion gets the better of you at times, but come on.  Be consistent.</p>
<p><strong>Milan outplayed us</strong> for a good 60 minutes.  But how many games this season did Juventus outplay another team, only to walk away with a loss?  Oh wait, that hasn&#8217;t happened yet.  I mean a draw.  Quite a few.  Again, that&#8217;s why you play the full 90.</p>
<p>Despite the result, in 3 games versus Milan this year, 2 wins and 1 draw is pretty good.  We&#8217;ll see them back in Turin for the second leg of the Copa.  Last night&#8217;s game will only make that fixture more fun.</p>
<p><strong>Sulley Muntari</strong> was denied a clear goal.  So was <strong>Ale Matri</strong>.  They cancel each other out, period.  <strong>Arturo Vidal</strong> did his best Felipe Melo impersonation and deserved his straight red, but both <strong>Mexes</strong> and <strong>Van Bommel</strong> <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urJ-uHJUsm0">*and* <strong>Muntari</strong></a> were lucky not to be shown the door way earlier.</p>
<p>I understand the argument that being down 2-0 would have made the game completely different than 1-0.  To that I can retort that a two-goal hole didn&#8217;t bury us when we were away in Naples.  Also, 2-0 11 vs. 11 is way different than 2-0 10 vs. 11.  You can argue hypotheticals all day, but the reality is what happened.  The most likely alternate ending would have been a 2-2 draw, with strikes from Nocerino and Muntari canceled out by a Matri brace.</p>
<p>This season is turning out to be a wild one, and whoever comes out on top will undoubtedly deserve it.  I have respect for <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Berlusconi</span> Milan, as much as I&#8217;d love to hate them.  They aren&#8217;t at Sfinter level for me.  The clubs have historocally had cordial relations with each other, and I have respect for our friends on that other <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://acmilan.theoffside.com/">Offside</a> page.  If the next decade is one of Juve and Milan slugging it out at the top of Serie A and reppin&#8217; Italy well in Europe, well &#8212; I can live with that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll see you all in May.  But in the meantime, there&#8217;s that whole Copa Italia thing&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh yea, and <strong>Conte</strong> &#8212; 3-5-2 &#8212; nev-er-again.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Oh, and there&#8217;s that whole little &#8220;Zlatan&#8221; thing.  And the whole &#8220;the team in black and red is owned by a hybrid Charlie Wilson goes Euro and becomes a Bond-Villain&#8221; thing.  No, I will never get tired of this.  Get used to it.  Especially now that he&#8217;s no longer Prime Minister, and I don&#8217;t need to worry about my Italian passport being revoked, although I may wish to keep an eye out for piercing, scandalous exposes about me being featured on Telemilano.  I&#8217;ll take my chances.</p>

<p>No, after failing to convince the appeals board that <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFRJCb8Qj8k">slapping </a>an opposing player in the face (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/recent/nitr/9f3a65cd.gif">reminiscent of Napoloen</a>) is not as bad as diving, <strong>Zlatan</strong> will be watching on the T-V-ihinovic (see what I did there?).  Great news, right?  Oh wait, this is a team that has strikers like <strong>Robinho</strong>, <strong>Pato</strong>, <strong>Cassano</strong>, and *<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vDD5Up3SWE">gasp</a>* <strong>Maxi Lopez</strong> at their disposal as well.  To that I say, thank God that the injury fairy flew from Turin a little farther East this season.</p>
<p><em>Le chiavi</em>:  I wrote <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://juventus.theoffside.com/team-news/round-5-6-fra-diavolo.html">back in October</a> that the key to this match would be using our strength out wide to exploit the narrow formation Milan prefers.  To be more precies, here were <em>le chiavi</em> for that match:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-size:12px;line-height:17px;padding-top:10px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-family:verdana, arial;margin:0px;">Tactics – wide and outside.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;line-height:17px;padding-top:10px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-family:verdana, arial;margin:0px;">Massimiliano Allegri likes to set up his squad in a 4-3-1-2 formation, making for a pretty narrow midfield.  Conte likes to use formations which are heavily reliant on wingers pressing forward and stretching the field.  However, this begs the question as to whether his conventional 4-4-2 will be the preferred antidote.  It’s looking like Milan’s midfield will consist of Seedorf, Van Bommel and Nocerino behind Aquilani. This would lead only Marchisio or Vidal to look out after our precious, most valuable turncoat (thank God he did), in a crowded centralized midfield.  Last week he employed a 4-2-3-1 for the first time this season.  Was that a harbinger of things to come?  Perhaps.  He could still employ wide players to stretch the field, while protecting the midfield where the most important battles will take place.  The personnel is certainly available.  It could be that last week the Count wanted give the new formation a whirl before he had to unleash it against a big team.  The fact that he has been conducting closed training sessions since at least Friday may be indicative of such.  Tuttosport, however, did reportedly capture footage of il mister in front of a whiteboard maniacally shouting in a Romanian accent, “Four-Two-Three-Von!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!”</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;line-height:17px;padding-top:10px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-family:verdana, arial;margin:0px;"><span style="font-family:verdana, arial;font-size:12px;line-height:17px;">At any rate, the wings will be the key, while a combination of </span><strong>Marchisio</strong><span style="font-family:verdana, arial;font-size:12px;line-height:17px;">, </span><strong>Vidal </strong><span style="font-family:verdana, arial;font-size:12px;line-height:17px;">and </span><strong>Pirlo </strong><span style="font-family:verdana, arial;font-size:12px;line-height:17px;">will better ensure that the latter doesn’t get destroyed in a crowded central midfield.  A triangle in the central area of the pitch of the three players rotating in and out of each other’s positions in some form or fashion has long been a dream of mine, sort of like Scarlett Johansson pictures leaking.  Sometimes dreams come true, although the former may not anytime soon due to Conte’s slow integration of newer players who are unaccustomed to Serie A and the Italian language into the squad.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-size:12px;line-height:17px;padding-top:10px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-family:verdana, arial;margin:0px;">While I was lying about Conte&#8217;s Count Chocula shtick, the wide strategy seems to still be on the table.  Only by now my wet dream about <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Scarlett Johansson</span> an M-V-P midfield is so old-hat that it has it&#8217;s own nickname, and the formation has been slowly shifting to a 3-5-2.  Conte first used it to mirror opponents playing the same formation (<em>see </em>Napoli, Udinese), neutralizing their free-flowing wingbacks.  Now, it&#8217;s starting to become part of the normal repertoire.  This allows for two things:  one, it keeps our three best midfielders on the pitch at once (M-V-P), as well as our three best centerbacks (C-B-B, eh it&#8217;s just not the same), and keeps Giorgio Chiellini out of the leftback position to the delight of my wife (I get cranky when he plays there).  It worked a couple weeks ago at San Siro.</p>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What used to drive me crazy about the Juve of old, and by old, I mean the past 5-6 years?  Simple.  Tactically labile coaching, or rather, lack thereof.  Be it personnel or formations.  This is one thing that I like about Conte.  Prior to the start of the season I wrote many times that with the personnel available a 4-3-3 better suited us than a 4-4-2.  Sorry, 4-2-4.  4-4-2 was like, so 2009, just like wire-framed glasses, which is why I <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/034/Hipster%20Glasses%20You%20know%20it%20s%20true_286934_1915044.jpg">wear these</a>.  I actually have 20/20 vision, I just pop out the lenses.  Anyway, agreeing with Jose, I&#8217;ve written that <strong>Aquilani </strong>maybe should have been kept (cheaply) to play with or as an alternative to <strong>Pirlo</strong>, in a 4-3-3/4-2-1-3/4-2-3-1; I was never convinced of Pirlo&#8217;s ability to play in a 2-man center midfield, in a pivot role.  Even though I still maintain that Conte reads the Offsides and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/#!/johncas1014">follows me on Twitter</a> (boy, am I <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">shameless</span></em>!), I cannot prove this.</p>
<p>Thus, the only logical conclusions I can reasonably arrive at are 1) some of the things I write actually make sense and 2) I&#8217;m not the only one who thinks so.  In fact, some very important and very smart people do as well.  Among them, il mister.  He&#8217;s shown a willingness to learn, grow, and switch things up based on the opponent and squad at his disposal not seen in past years.  But even this has been somewhat limited thus far.<br />
<span id="more-7478"></span></p>
<p>Again &#8212; we remain undefeated.  However, our draw totals almost equal our wins.  True, Conte has demonstrated his tactical flexibility, but one area where he remains steadfast is his preference for industrious players over creative ones.  The <strong>Simone Pepes</strong> are preferred over the <strong>Milos Krasics</strong>, and even moving <strong>Chiellini </strong>to left back over the faster, better-crossing <strong>Paolo De Ceglie</strong> represented a defensively-safer but more boring choice.  This has paid off against Sfinter, Milan, etc., but doesn&#8217;t &#8212; and will not &#8212; against teams that play a 9-0-1 (see Siena, Parma, etc.).  Whereas it&#8217;s been proven that <strong>Conte &gt; Delneri</strong>, one troubling similarity is that <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/soccer/02/11/digby.juventus/index.html">hustle over flair</a> seems tantamount to GDN&#8217;s preference for counter-attacking.  It doesn&#8217;t work when the other team is all too willing to soak up pressure, counter-attack your counter-attack, and ultimately be happy with one point.  We&#8217;re at the stage where we can no longer be happy with +1&#8217;s.  We need +3&#8217;s.  Lots of them.</p>
<div id="attachment_7479" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width:439px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-7479  " src="http://juventus.theoffside.com/files/2012/02/6ntx.jpg" alt="&quot;Put me in, coach...I'm ready to play...&quot;" width="429" height="574"/><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;Put me in, coach...I&#39;m ready to play...&quot;</p></div>
<p>To that I say, Conte:  unleash the Elia.  Conte has said that Elia has been improving and become the type of player that he needs, and he&#8217;ll be unleashed when we least expect it.  Well, coach &#8212; I don&#8217;t expect it right now.  I swear.  Now&#8217;s the time to put him in the friggin game, take advantage of his skill and trickery, and let&#8217;s take care of this <em>provinciale</em>.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
<p><strong>My starting XI:</strong> (4-3-3) Gigi; Martin, Giorgio, Barzagli, Lichtsteiner; Claudio, Bon Pirlo, <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Arturo</span><span style="text-decoration:line-through;"> (forgot he&#8217;s suspended)</span> Mr. Brown; Elia, Matri, Quagmire.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not going to be the lineup.  But there isn&#8217;t anything else for me to write.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<span id="more-7466"></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Juventus by the numbers</strong></p>
<p>So, we are past the midpoint of the season and it is time to see what happened in the first 19 games.  When the final whistle blew on January 21<sup>st</sup> against Atalanta, Juventus had played all teams in Serie A and in doing so accumulated 41 points, allowing 12 goals, and scoring 31.  On January 21<sup>st</sup> we had played 9 games at the brand new Juventus Stadium and 10 games away.  I thought this was a good point in the season to recap everything that Juventus has done since last May and most importantly to figure out whether we are reaching our objectives.  In order to assess this, we need to be honest and think about our goals for the 2011-2012 season.  For some, playing in the Europa League next season maybe sufficient (but who am I kidding, no Interisti reads this blog).  For others, finishing top three is the goal and yet for a few it is the scudetto or nothing.  Here is what I wanted from this season:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualify to CL</li>
<li>Stop choking against small opposition</li>
<li>Get rid of prima donnas</li>
<li>Become <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">more</span> consistent</li>
<li>Stop conceding goals left, right and center</li>
<li>Stop conceding goals in the final minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind, lets get comfortable and let’s talk Juve&#8230;</p>
<p align="center"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><img class="size-full wp-image-7467        aligncenter" src="http://juventus.theoffside.com/files/2012/02/1.jpg" alt="Delneri was too busy trying to figure out how to fix the team..." width="454" height="307"/></p>

<p><strong>From May to August</strong></p>
<p>The mercato has been talked about extensively so I won’t go into much detail.  Essentially, Juventus exercised the option to buy on most players we had on loan.  The most notable exception was of course Alberto Aquilani.  This choice was made based on the fact that il Mister was going to play a 4-4-2 and there was no need for too many CMs, specially not the ones that can slow down the match and control the tempo (more on this later).</p>
<p>Although Marotta and Paratici were not able to bring a champion to Turin, they brought some good, decent, and very good players familiar with Serie A; the most important ones being Pirlo, Vucinic, and Lichtsteiner.  To top things off, they brought promising Bundelisga stars: Arturo Vidal and Elijero Elia.</p>
<p>In addition to the recruitment of new talent to the team, the management chose Antonio Conte to lead Juventus for the 11-12 season.  I believe the choice of Conte was for two reasons: 1) To have a coach that could use the players and modules already set in place by Delneri and 2) Hire a coach approved by the fans who may be given time to grow by the tifosi.  In all honesty, I don’t think the management thought Conte would be such a hit, however, I am sure they are not complaining.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we were not able to get rid of Amauri or Grosso by August (Did you know Grosso actually played this season? I almost forgot!).  Iaquinta and Toni also sat on the bench and did nothing between September and January.  Getting rid of all of these players (except for Grosso) in January is quite an accomplishment by Marotta.</p>
<p>A quick aside must be made regarding the great job Paratici has done with regards to the youth teams.  Secco’s project consisted of buying Diego and Felipe Melo and hoping things will turn out ok.  Marotta and Paratici are buying promising talents that can slowly be inserted into the team.  Most of them will go out on loan before coming to Juve, just like is the case in most Italian clubs.  However, it is clear that this management is trying to put a lot more emphasis on youth than the other big Italian clubs.  With the FIFA Fair Play system coming into effect, this is the only way to move forward.</p>
<p>All in all, I believe the mercato was very good.  Marotta will always going to find it hard to lure champions to a team that has held 7<sup>th</sup> place for 2 consecutive years with his small budget.  With that being said, the summer of 2011 was a step in the right direction.  Given the fact that Juve is now playing a 3-man midfield, I think one big error in the summer was not bringing Aquilani.  He would have been a useful backup and could have been bought for little money.  However, hindsight is 20/20 and one way or another we are top of the table.</p>
<div id="attachment_7470" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width:620px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-7470" src="http://juventus.theoffside.com/files/2012/02/3.jpg" alt="Three of those four are Marotta&#x002019;s buys, just sayin." width="610" height="365"/><p class="wp-caption-text">Three of those four are Marotta’s buys, just sayin.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">September to January</span></p>
<p>How good has Juve been this season?  Well, we are first after 19 games so we must be doing well.  This of course is the simple answer and is similar to what Secco probably told Gigli after Juve finished 3<sup>rd</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> in the 07-08 and 08-09 seasons.  In reality, the team was crumbling before everyone’s eyes and the numbers just served to extend Secco’s tenure until the team really crashed in 09-10.</p>
<p>To assess Conte’s Juve, I have chosen to compare it to the Juve of Delneri and Ferrara.  Included in this comparison are also this year’s Milan and the scudetto winning Milan of 2010-2011 stats.  I have also added Juventus 05-06 (Capello’s unbeatable side) to show how far we are from being an unstoppable force in Italy.</p>
<p>In the first 19 matches of the season, Conte has obtained 8 more points than Ferrara’s team and 10 more than Delneri’s.  Now, if you want to be pessimistic, we have 11 points less than Capello’s Juve, but we all know this Juve is not the one of 06.  And how do we fair against Milan? We obviously have more points this season than them, but we also have one more point than what AC Milan had last year at this time.  In other words, this is the best Juve of the last three years (no news there) but we are almost equally as good as the “scudetto worthy” AC Milan of 2010-2011.</p>
<p align="center">
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-7471 aligncenter" src="http://juventus.theoffside.com/files/2012/02/01-points-accum.jpg" alt="Points accumulated over 19 rounds" width="596" height="253"/></p>
<p>And that is not all!  Juve’s rise to the top has been consistent (Yes, I was beginning to forget that word).  Ferrara’s Juve was better than Conte’s until Round 7.  In round 8, Ferrara’s team was one point behind Conte’s and in round 11, four points behind.  Although that gap decreases to two points in round 13, it widens again to seven points in round 17<sup>th</sup>.  As a matter of fact, Ferrara’s team slows down significantly in round 15, obtaining only 3 points between round 15 and round 19.  I was always under the impression that January was bad for Ferrara but it appears that since early December the problems were there.</p>
<p>Delneri’s Juve is actually worse than Ferrara’s Juve, (and by extension worse than Conte’s Juve), when looking at accumulated points.  Delneri never had more points than Conte.  The closest Delneri comes is 2 points less than Conte in round 7<sup>th</sup>.  The difference extends to 6 points in round 12.  Delneri’s Juve slowed down in round 17, finishing the first round of games with three defeats.  This is of course when Quagliarella got injured and our season went down the toilet.</p>
<p>Will Conte’s Juve slow down as the season goes on? Given that even Capello’s Juve of 06 slowed down during the second half of the season I am inclined to believe that we probably will.  The more important question is how much will they slow down.  So far, our pace doesn’t appear to be changing much.  We have not lost a single match and the worst consecutive record we have is 2 draws in a row (which happened twice this season).  I think something that can cause us to slow down is losing LIchtsteiner for a long time or Vucinic.  For that reason, getting Quagliarella and Caceres up and running as soon as possible is essential.  Quags and Caceres are not like-for-like replacements of Vucinic and Lichtsteiner (maybe ADP resembles Vucinic more) but they are the most likely alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>How did we get here?</strong></p>
<p>First off, I think what Conte did with what Marotta gave him is spectacular.  It is fair to say that many of the players in our starting 11 are really not significantly better than some of our bench players.  For instance, bringing in DeCeglie on the left and benching Bonucci doesn’t significantly decrease the quality of our team, but it encourages Bonucci to train to be at his best.  The same can be said about Estigarribia, Pepe, and Giaccherini.  Actually, the determination of these players has surpassed the natural ability that Krasic and Elia have.  Krasic has played poorly, but he has also not changed his playing style to suit our team like Giaccherini and Pepe have.  Elia right now is at the bottom of the pecking order and after the last twitter scandal I don’t think we will see much of him.</p>
<p>Something else that I think has been remarkably helpful is that Conte was honest with our players.  For the first year since we came back from Serie B, there are no players talking about winning the scudetto after winning 2 games in a row (Bonucci’s scudetto remarks last year drove me insane).  This is most significant given the fact that we are doing better than any other year since 06.  I believe that a huge reason for this is Conte’s honesty.  He has said time and again that we need to give 120% to win every game and the players have come to believe this.  Our coach knows full well that we are not world beaters and our players know full well that nothing will be handed to them.</p>
<p>One things that I like about Conte’s Juve is an invariable playing philosophy.  We press relentlessly for 90 minutes, we do not give up the ball cheaply, and the players help each other both offensively and defensively.  This has been pivotal in our success.  No matter whether we play a 4-4-2, 4-2-3-1, 3-5-2, 9-0-1, or a 1-0-9 the philosophy is the same.</p>
<p>This philosophy is also that of a big team.  With Delneri we defended and hit on the counter.  Although that may work against AC Milan, Inter, or Manchester City, it is not a winning strategy against Lecce, Bari, or Salzburg.  Juve needs to have the ball, call the shots, and impose their rhythm.</p>
<p>This philosophy has also helped us have the best defensive record in the league.  While Delneri and Ferrara’s Juve allowed 25 and 24 goals respectively, Conte’s Juve has allowed 12 goals (0.6 goals/game) in the first 19 games of the season.  Capello’s Juve allowed 10 goals in the same period of time (only two less than Conte).  That is a pretty sweet record given the fact this is Conte’s first year as coach of Juve.    Comparing our defensive record to Milan makes us look even better.  We have allowed 5 goals less than Milan did at this point in the season last year.</p>
<p align="center"><img class="size-full wp-image-7472" src="http://juventus.theoffside.com/files/2012/02/4.jpg" alt="Behind the great numbers is this man (and I don&#x002019;t mean the little guy)." width="425" height="594"/></p>
<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter">
<dl>
<dd>Behind the great numbers is this man (and I don’t mean the little guy).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>How about goals scored?  This is the area were we are not doing too good.  We have scored 2 and 3 goals less than Delneri and Ferrara respectively.  We have also scored 3 goals less than AC Milan last year and 4 less than Milan this year.  Two or three goals do not appear to be a huge difference but when you consider the number of shots we have in each of our games, these numbers are a little worrisome.  Part of it may be due to how the team is always helping out in defense.  Personally, I don’t care.  Even though Juve is not scoring many goals they are playing very entertaining matches.  Interestingly, 11 players have scored for us this far.  Our midfield (Marchisio, Pepe, Vidal, Estigarribia, Giaccherini, and Krasic) has scored 16 goals.  Our forwards (Vucinic, Matri, Quags) has scored 11 goals.  I think that if our attack picks up, we can really cruise to success.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-7473 aligncenter" src="http://juventus.theoffside.com/files/2012/02/03-goals-scored-first-half.jpg" alt="Goals scored during the first half of the season." width="580" height="255"/></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In summary, Marotta, Paratici and Conte have built a very impressive team from players that are not necessarily impressive.  I know everyone here wants to win the scudetto, but even if we are not able, we have a very strong basis to build from.  Many of the players in this team will be capable reserves in one or two seasons.  These reserves will have the work ethic to teach the youngsters that scudetti are not deserved but earned (not matter what Massimo Moratti says).  Our current players will teach the new acquisitions that blood and sweat are necessary when playing for Juve.  And with time, all players will know that at Juve vincere non é importante, ma é la unica cosa che conta.</p>]]></content:encoded>
